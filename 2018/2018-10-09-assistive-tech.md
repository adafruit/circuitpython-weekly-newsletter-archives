## CircuitPython creates new assistive tech opportunities

[![CircuitPython creates new assistive tech opportunities]({{ "/assets/at109.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](http://atmakers.org/2018/10/circuitpython-creates-new-at-opportunities/)

Bill from [ATmakers.org](http://atmakers.org) has a fantastic article ["CircuitPython creates new assistive tech opportunities"](http://atmakers.org/2018/10/circuitpython-creates-new-at-opportunities/) - which describes the features and benefits of using CircuitPython for assistive tech including: Lots of board options, Circuit Playground Express, Adafruit’s Feather Line, Itsy Bitsy and Trinket boards, and Simple Programming and Customization. 

"Perhaps the biggest benefit to using CircuitPython instead of other options like Arduino is that there is no IDE or programmer you need to purchase or install.  In fact, when you plug in one of these devices, they show up as normal USB Mass Storage devices–that is, they look like thumb drives!

They have a text file named “main.py” on them that you can edit with any text editor (notepad, Emacs, etc.) or use an editor like Mu that has built-in Python syntax support, but is still just a text editor.

Why is this important?  It means that you can let your end-user modify the system!  Our new KeySwitch device will have a “Settings.ini” file that end-users can edit to change how each switch should behave." - [Read more and thank you Bill!](http://atmakers.org/2018/10/circuitpython-creates-new-at-opportunities/)

## Coming soon CircuitPython powered props!

[![Coming soon CircuitPython powered props]({{ "/assets/prop109.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://youtu.be/D1fb-AHd34E?t=3222)

We are wrapping up the Adafruit Prop-Maker Wing. CircuitPython is great for making interactive projects that light up, make sound, and react to movement. We've seen some great lightsaber builds and came up with a Wing just for prop makers! It has a class D amplifier for sound effects, can drive an 3 Watt RGB LED for bright lighting effects, has a built in accelerometer and a plug-n-play neopixel driver. We even made it easy to keep your prop running during all-day con's with a power down pin to minimize current draw - [video.](https://youtu.be/D1fb-AHd34E?t=3222)

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is 101!
