## Adding a WiFI Co-Processor to CircuitPython

[![Adding a WiFI Co-Processor to CircuitPython]({{ "/assets/01_1218blinka_esp.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-wifi-co-processor-to-circuitpython-esp8266-esp32?view=all)

Surf the 'net with Blinka! We love Blinka & CircuitPython, and want to share it with the world! But how can we get CircuitPython talking to everyone?

This guide will show you how to connect your CircuitPython board to the Internet, by using an ESP8266 or ESP32 as the 'Wireless modem' - we'll even show you how to upload the required AT command firmware to the chip, all from your CircuitPython board - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-wifi-co-processor-to-circuitpython-esp8266-esp32?view=all)

Installing CircuitPython on SAMD21 Boards like the Arduino MKR ZERO by Shawn Hymel.  Some SAMD21-based boards, like the Circuit Playground Express, METRO M0 Express, and Feather M0 Express, are designed to work with CircuitPython out of the box. Others, like the Arduino MKRZero, require a little more work. This guide will show you how to install CircuitPython on a variety of SAMD21-based boards - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/installing-circuitpython-on-samd21-boards?view=all)

## CircuitPython in 2019

As 2018 comes to a close we like to reflect on how the year went and set goals for 2019. In the last two years ([2017](https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/01/09/welcome-to-the-adafruit-circuitpython-beta/), [2018](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/01/29/circuitpython-in-2018/)) this has been a blog post by Scott (aka tannewt). For 2019, we’d like to do it a bit differently. This time we’d like everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the Internet.

We’ll read these over the holidays and into the first half of January. After the January 14th CircuitPython weekly we’ll draft an overarching vision post for CircuitPython in 2019 and discuss it in the following meeting.

See [the blog post for more details](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/17/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2019-circuitpython2019-circuitpython/).

CircuitPython powered Snowflake boards at Stanford's lab64. The event was held to get students excited about electronics regardless of their experience. Students could pick up a snowflake at various “stages,” whether it be presoldered, half-soldered, unprogrammed, etc. lab64 held a snowflake “design contest” that accepted SVG submissions for the board outline, students assembled the board following the [interactive BOM](https://maholli.github.io/snowflake/), [GitHub](https://github.com/maholli/snowflake), [soldering guide](https://github.com/maholli/tutorials/tree/master/soldering%20101), and [gallery](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/lab64-makerspace/holliday-party?authuser=0).

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Check back next week for more Learn guides on using CircuitPython libraries with Raspberry Pi!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **117**!

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

* [Adafruit CircuitPython MotorKit](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MotorKit)

* [Adafruit CircuitPython PN532](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PN532)

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/helloworld550.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
