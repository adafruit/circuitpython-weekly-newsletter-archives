## Python on Hardware at Digi-Key!

[![Python on Hardware at Digi-Key! ]({{ "/assets/102code.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](http://python.digikey.com/)

This is a big deal for the maker, pro-maker and engineers out there, Digi-Key (and Adafruit) are helping to lead the movement towards ease of use and the powerful features of Python, now coming to hardware. From MicroPython to CircuitPython, there are more choices than ever depending on what people want to make, what devices/sensors they want to use, and how fast they want to get up and running.

Digi-Key has a one stop resource for all of us with all the Python running hardware at Digi-Key, include Adafruit’s CircuitPython boards. The handy URL is: [http://python.digikey.com/](http://python.digikey.com)

## CircuitPython on a FEATHER FORM FACTOR FPGA???

Maybe :) ... What is this?? "It’s a Lattice Semi ICE40UP5K based TinyFPGA in the Adafruit feather form factor.  It has built in delta-sigma ADC and DAC, high-efficiency switching power supplies, built-in  battery charger with automatic switch-over, micro sd card support, and a Raspberry Pi camera connector." - [Luke Valenty @TinyFPGA](https://twitter.com/TinyFPGA/status/1046217580829007872)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We've recently added a number of new libraries including the [VEML6075](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_VEML6075) and the [HTU21D-F](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HTU21D). As we continue to add more libraries and update current ones, we're going to be keeping you up to date on the state of the CircuitPython libraries!

The total number of CircuitPython libraries is 109!
