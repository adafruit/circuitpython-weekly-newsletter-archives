It's been a few months since the initial stable release of 3.0.0 and we've been hard at work on 4.0.0 since then. Last week we [released 4.0.0 Alpha 1](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/4.0.0-alpha.1), the first pre-release of 4.0.0, the next major revision of CircuitPython. 4.0.0 will feature support for the nRF52840 BLE chipset, display support and translated messages (English, French, German, Spanish and Tagalog so far). More features will likely be added in the next few months as well. Follow along [on our Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

Adding support for a new chipset is a huge undertaking. With the launch of this first alpha, we're close to bringing the CircuitPython edit-save-run workflow we all know and love to the nRF52840. We are still working on adding all of the standard APIs though. Adafruit hasn't released any hardware yet with the nRF52840 so we've been using [the nRF52840 development kit](https://octopart.com/nrf52840-dk-nordic+semiconductor-91117168) and [nRF52840 Dongle](https://octopart.com/nrf52840-dongle-nordic+semiconductor-92233705) for testing. Pick one up if you want a jump start on testing.

This is just the beginning for 4.0.0 development and we'll be focusing on it for the next few months. Follow along with GitHub and [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord) and expect lots of improvements and bug fixes along with it.
