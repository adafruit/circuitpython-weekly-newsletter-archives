We are making a CircuitPython based gaming platform! We're still in the early days of development and [research](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/06/04/video-game-museum-the-museum-of-art-and-digital-entertainment-themade/). While we're designing our own modern handheld ([LEEKed last week](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/05/25/we-are-making-a-circuitpython-based-gaming-platform-adafruit/)), we also want to build an solid software foundation for game development (likely based on pygame.) The goal is to make porting games from one handheld to another relatively simple. That will allow migration from an Adafruit handheld to a retro handheld like the Nintendo Gameboy or Sega Game Gear or to a third party handheld like the [uGame](https://www.tindie.com/products/deshipu/game-10-game-console-kit/). We would love feedback and collaboration. Links to open source handheld and pygame games would be very welcome! Please reach out to us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord) to help out!

## CRICKIT O' THE WEEK!

[![There is no sanctuary]({{ "/assets/logan.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://youtu.be/33vwbVZoKe8)

"There is no sanctuary" - Logan's Run. Logan's Theremin with CRICKIT NeoPixels & sound. This demo is how to control a light sensitive CRICKIT with NeoPixel "theremin" - [video](https://youtu.be/33vwbVZoKe8) & [code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/master/Crickits/carousel/code.py).

## LEEKS!

[![CRICKIT FEATHER]({{ "/assets/crickit-feather.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/04/24/the-adafruit-feather-wing-is-a-thing-adafruit-adafruit/)

This week the PCBs (printed circuit boards) arrived for the upcoming FEATHER Crickit. This means the entire FEATHER ecosystem will be part of the CircuitPython-based robotics platform, Crickit. From IoT robots to the 100+ FEATHER WINGS, all robot, all the time.
