[![Lightning Talk at Pycon - CircuitPython! video]({{ "/assets/pycon-lightning-talk.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTAFl8P2DkE&feature=youtu.be&t=48m56s)

This morning we're having the last of our code sprints for CircuitPython at PyCon US 2018. It's been an amazing whirlwind so far for us. The three of us decided to participate in the "hallway track" by skipping most of the recorded talks and focussing on meeting people. Scott ([@tannewt](https://github.com/tannewt/)) gave [a lightning talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTAFl8P2DkE&feature=youtu.be&t=48m56s) the first day. [Dan](https://github.com/dhalbert/) and [Kattni](https://github.com/kattni/) organized excellent open spaces where people could come play with their new [Gemma M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3501)s from Adafruit and [CircuitPlayground Advanced Packs](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2769) [thanks to Microsoft](https://twitter.com/nnja/status/994742501511778304). The first day of our two day sprint saw a dozen or so folks come to get their hands dirty in all things CircuitPython. Join us next week for our weekly meeting for all of the details.

We've enjoyed meeting the people who make up the Python community and learning about their diverse uses of Python from [side channel attack analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT2xjgUInhQ) and [generating music from data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EXvR1shVFQ) to [visualizing algorithms with DotStars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJpUlnfwjbk) and [practical Sphinx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ROZRNZkPS8). All of the talks, keynotes and lightning talks are recorded and available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsX05-2sVSH7Nx3zuk3NYuQ/videos). Join us on [our Discord](https://adafru.it/discord) as we digest the PyCon experience and the awesome talks we missed.

## New stable MicroPython release!

[MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) has released [v1.9.4](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.9.4) with [support for the ESP32](https://micropython.org/download#esp32)! It also has improvements to the STM32 port, optional stack allocation of python objects and reduce code size of the Python parser.

Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.9.4) for a full list and download it from [micropython.org](https://micropython.org/download).
