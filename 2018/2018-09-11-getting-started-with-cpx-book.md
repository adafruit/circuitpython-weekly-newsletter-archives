## Make it with CircuitPython!

[![Getting Started with Adafruit Circuit Playground Express]({{ "/assets/911cover.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1680454889/)

On September 10th, Make published a new book [Getting Started with Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1680454889/) written by Adafruit consulting engineer Mike Barela! The book covers using the Circuit Playground Express in Microsoft MakeCode, CircuitPython, and setting up an Arduino environment and libraries.

This book is part of the Make Getting Started series for folks who may not have had much exposure to microcontrollers or may have only worked in one language like MakeCode and would like to learn another like CircuitPython. Advanced coders may wish to recommend the book to beginners or to have it as an introductory reference. The book is in a format such that educators may use it to get students working quickly with microcontrollers.

Mike will be giving a talk at [Maker Fair New York City](https://makerfaire.com/new-york/) in Zone 3 "MAKE: Electronics by Digi Key" on Sunday, 9/23/18, 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM. Make should have the book available at various Maker Faire vendors. Mike will stick around afterwards to talk to folks and sign copies of the book. Coordinate with all Adafruit folks at World Maker Faire via [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## A new eBook with CircuitPython!

[![CircuitPython Development Workshop]({{ "/assets/911ebook.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="333px"}](https://www.amazon.com/CircuitPython-Development-Workshop-Agus-Kurniawan-ebook/dp/B07H2BDQLD)

[CircuitPython Development Workshop](https://www.amazon.com/CircuitPython-Development-Workshop-Agus-Kurniawan-ebook/dp/B07H2BDQLD) Kindle Edition by Agus Kurniawan. CircuitPython is a development framework for embedded system based MicroPython. This book helps you to get started with CircuitPython development. This book uses Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0 Express board for development testing board. The following is a list of highlight topics in this book: Preparing Development Environment, Setting Up CircuitPython, GPIO Programming, PWM and Analog Input, Working with I2C, Working with UART, Working with SPI, Working with DHT Module - [Amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/CircuitPython-Development-Workshop-Agus-Kurniawan-ebook/dp/B07H2BDQLD)

## Coming soon - Wing it' & use the force

Inspired by our latest Hallowing Lightsaber project, we thought it would be neat to have a 'Saber 'Wing for general purpose props and sabers. This is our first attempt at a layout - it has an audio amplifier, 3 axis accelerometer to detect swings/hits, NeoPixel port with level shifting, switch pins for mode selection, and an RGB driver circuit that can power a 1 Watt LED or an RGB mode indicator!

[@geekgirlbeta's](https://twitter.com/geekgirlbeta) PyCon Australia [talk](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45177-lighting-macro-photographs-with-circuitpython/), "Lighting Macro Photographs with CircuitPython. LED lighting rigs are expensive. Worse, they have little to no controls aside from on/off. Most are not dimmable and changing colors requires the use of gels. In this talk I will discuss how CircuitPython was used in conjunction with LEDs and microcontrollers to make a custom LED photo lighting rig." - [YouTube.](https://youtu.be/JAgCZ70Q3sg). Pictured above, a great slide from the talk!
