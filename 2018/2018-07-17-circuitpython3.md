[![CircuitPython 3.0.0 Logo]({{ "/assets/circuitpython300a.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/3.0.0)

It's here!!! Last week the CircuitPython team released the first stable version of [CircuitPython 3.0.0](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/3.0.0)! It brings support for the SAMD51 (aka M4) that is available now in the [Metro](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3382), [Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857) and [ItsyBitsy](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800) form factors. It also features a number of other improvements that make it the best version of CircuitPython yet! We highly recommend [updating](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-circuitpython#download-the-latest-version).

As always, thank you to the 50+ people who helps make the CircuitPython project and community great. We can't do it without you. Newcomers are always welcome to participate [on Discord](), in the [weekly meeting](https://youtu.be/xBWaIQLYbvQ), and [on GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github). Join us as we continue to make CircuitPython better!

Our next major release will be 4.0 and will support the nRF52840 which adds native USB to a chipset with Bluetooth Low Energy. So, CircuitPython is going wireless! Stay tuned for more details.

## News from around the web!

[![NumWorks - New OS]({{ "/assets/numworks716.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.numworks.com/)

Over the past year the team at [NumWorks](https://www.numworks.com/), the [Python-based](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3790) calculator, worked with high school educators & students and have added a ton of features. If you have one of these calculators you can [update it now](https://workshop.numworks.com/devices) to get the new features.

The NumWorks Graphing Calculator matches all the requirements of the ACT calculator policy and is permitted for use on that test. It is also permitted for use on the SAT by the College Board starting with the August 2018 administration. The online simulator [is here](https://www.numworks.com/simulator/).

Features include: Advanced graphing, Natural writing input, Equation and system solver, Statistics and regressions, New Python editor, AND ...  "Python Workshop" an online python workshop that allows sync'ing of scripts between your computer and your calculator, edit and save your scripts online, and browse a comprehensive library of scripts written by other users.

**A Coming of Age for CircuitPython**

Over on the hackster.io blogs, Alasdair Allan, has an article ["A Coming of Age for CircuitPython"](https://blog.hackster.io/a-coming-of-age-for-circuitpython-efb1b9c61aa3) - good read ... *"we’re now heading directly towards another, with interpreted languages like Javascript and Python becoming the new normal for development.*

*When new hardware arrives being Arduino-compatible is still important, but increasingly new boards also advertise support for a higher level language, with support for MicroPython, and Adafruit’s custom fork CircuitPython, being firmly in the lead."* - [Read more](https://blog.hackster.io/a-coming-of-age-for-circuitpython-efb1b9c61aa3).
