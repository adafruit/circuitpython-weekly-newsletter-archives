## Python snakes its way to the CASIO Graphing fx-CG50 PRIZM calculator 

[![CASIO’s Graphing – fx-CG50 PRIZM calculator]({{ "/assets/01a_1211casio_micropython.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/06/python-snakes-its-way-to-the-casio-graphing-fx-cg50-prizm-calculator-casioeducate-casiojapan-micropython-micropython/)

[CASIO’s Graphing – fx-CG50 PRIZM calculator](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/06/python-snakes-its-way-to-the-casio-graphing-fx-cg50-prizm-calculator-casioeducate-casiojapan-micropython-micropython/) is the second calculator that we know of that is running a port of MicroPython. The first one we saw was [NumWorks](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3790), it runs MicroPython 1.9.1, the operating system is called epsilon. And now there are two, this may be a trend.

CASIO’s Graphing fx-CG50 PRIZM calculator also runs MicroPython, slightly different version, 1.9.4. The USA one that is shipping has this pre-installed, at least it was on mine, which is running the CASIO version OS 3.20.0202. On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CASIOJapan/status/1069761266040750080) we saw that CASIO Japan has an update that can be downloaded to add Python support for the Japanese version. On page y-1 of the manual, it has the license information for MicroPython (MIT license). On the [MicroPython forums](https://forum.micropython.org/search.php?keywords=casio&terms=all&author=&sc=1&sf=all&sr=posts&sk=t&sd=d&st=0&ch=300&t=0&submit=Search) it looks like there is some discussion about the CASIO MicroPython port, not sure for which calculator though.

We tried to do “import uos” and that module is not supported, looks like just “math” and “random”.

[![CASIO’s Graphing – fx-CG50 PRIZM calculator]({{ "/assets/01c_1211casioUSB.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/06/python-snakes-its-way-to-the-casio-graphing-fx-cg50-prizm-calculator-casioeducate-casiojapan-micropython-micropython/)

Our favorite feature is going to Connection mode, USB Flash after plugging in the USB cable, and the CASIO storage shows up like a USB drive (like CircuitPython!) from there you can edit/save Python (.py) files for running on the calculator. The VID/PID is – idVendor: 0x07CF / idProduct: 0x6102, 0x0409: “CASIO MassStorage Device”

[![CASIO’s Graphing – fx-CG50 PRIZM calculator]({{ "/assets/01b_1211casioflash.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/06/python-snakes-its-way-to-the-casio-graphing-fx-cg50-prizm-calculator-casioeducate-casiojapan-micropython-micropython/)

The chip appears to be a [Renesas CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_graphic_calculators#fx-CG_Prizm_series). There are some CASIO hackers out there, while it’s unclear what is supported on this newer calc, [these add-on utils](http://gbl08ma.com/casio-prizm-software/) worked.

Python is one of the most popular programming languages, and it's now becoming a standard part of the educational experience, including Python on at least two calculators used for AP, SAT, SAT Subject, PSAT / NMSQT, ACT & IB testing.

## Using LoraWAN and The Things Network with CircuitPython

[![Using LoraWAN and The Things Network with CircuitPython]({{ "/assets/02_1211wireless_P1000318.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-lorawan-and-the-things-network-with-circuitpython?view=all)

Here's how to build a small weather-logging node using an Adafruit Feather and a temperature sensor. The captured data will then be sent over LoRaWAN to The Things Network.

Using CircuitPython, you can get this project up and running on the Things Network quicker than ever. Also, since we're using CircuitPython, this guide is compatible with Python Linux boards, like the Raspberry Pi family - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-lorawan-and-the-things-network-with-circuitpython?view=all)

## Particle Mesh is here! CircuitPython runs on it :)

We have an alpha alpha alpha of CircuitPython running on the boards – you need a JLINK to replace the bootloader and we do not have wireless radio support yet, but NeoPixels, digital pins, and peripherals. So at this time, it’s basically a very fast FEATHER - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/07/particle-mesh-is-here-particlemesh-particle-iot/).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/1211_hello.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
