## This newsletter is now 2 years old! Happy Birthday!

[![happy 2 years]({{ "/assets/01_1242years.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/)

We started this newsletter 2 years ago, thank you everyone who has contributed to it and makes the community a great place to share and celebrate all the code, projects, people, and more together! We now have the complete archives from the last 2 years available as well - [https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/)


## CircuitPython snakes its way to SparkFun Pro nRF52840 Mini

[![SparkFun Pro nRF52840 Mini]({{ "/assets/02_124sfeboard.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="500px"}](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15025)

One of our goals with making a great open-source platforms is for not only the community to learn from, use, and extend them, but other companies that also do open-source hardware and software to use and extend. We are thrilled to see CircuitPython on the [SparkFun Pro nRF52840 Mini – Bluetooth Development Board – DEV-15025.](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15025)

"The board comes pre-programmed with a USB bootloader. You can develop programs for the nRF52840’s Cortex-M4 using either Arduino, [CircuitPython](https://youtu.be/OYTAytwIQCY?t=48), or C (using Nordic’s nRF5 SDK), and load that compiled code using a USB serial or mass-storage interface."

**We asked Jim, "Why CircuitPython for the nRF52840?"**

*"I'm so excited to see what projects our community develops using the nRF52840. With an ARM Cortex-M4, a 2.4GHz radio, and built-in USB, the nRF52840 is a powerful, versatile hardware platform. The platform's support for CircuitPython doubles my excitement, as it expands the hardware's reach across the map -- from students and teachers to web-developers and engineers."* -Jim Lindblom, Engineer, SparkFun

[![nRF52840 Development with Arduino and CircuitPython guide]({{ "/assets/03_124sfe.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="271px"}](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/nrf52840-development-with-arduino-and-circuitpython)

Check out the [nRF52840 Development with Arduino and CircuitPython guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/nrf52840-development-with-arduino-and-circuitpython) and it’s worth noting a lot of the advances in development for dev boards is a result of the open-source uf2 bootloader.

[![coming soon]({{ "/assets/04_124840.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.adafruit.com/new)

The Adafruit Feather nRF52840 will be shipping soon we’ve previewed it a few times on our weekly show and here in the Python on hardware newsletter, we have some changes to the software and some final testing on the hardware we do first, expect it in the Adafruit store soon.

## More snakin' - CircuitPython snakes its way to particle mesh

[![Iot-Python]({{ "/assets/05_124mesh.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/bboser/iotpython)

Here is an initial “port” for the [particle mesh devices](https://www.particle.io/mesh/) to run CircuitPython by [Bernhard Boser](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~boser/) - [GitHub.](https://github.com/bboser/iotpython) To get going, use a Segger to install Adafruit’s bootloader, clone [https://github.com/bboser/iotpython](https://github.com/bboser/iotpython), run make V=1 BOARD=particle_mesh SD=s140 in ports/nrf, press the reset button twice in rapid succession, copy firmware.uf2 to the disk.

## Interview with Profressor Bernhard Boser

We reached out to Profressor Bernhard Boser for some more information about the port and more, here is our interview conducted over email.

**Who are you and what are you up to?**

*I’m a professor at UC Berkeley, designing chips. Presently mostly gyroscopes and a chip for intraoperative detection of tumors (means a device that tells the surgeon where the cancer cells are). More on my perpetually [outdated website.](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~boser/)*

**What is EE 49: Electronics for IoT?**

*I used microcontrollers right when they were invented (intel 4004). They were amazing then, but we never would have imagined what they can do today. The “vision” for EE49 is to put microcontrollers programming into the hands of “everyone” (or whoever sees a use, but certainly not just engineers), a bit like everyone uses computers.*

*Teaching the class gives me a chance to play with all this cool stuff. It’s a lot of fun for me, and the students with their questions and ideas are always a great motivation.*
 
**Why use CircuitPython, etc.?**

*You did most of the hard work. Documentation and libraries are fantastic. Credit also goes to Damien George who started the MicroPython project and efforts like Arduino.*

**What is Iot-Python?**

*Today, not much. The goal is to play with a few additional capabilities of microcontrollers. A first goal is to make it easier to build battery powered applications. A very early prototype, [eventio](https://github.com/bboser/eventio), manages to blink LEDs (or grab sensor data) and monitor GPIO pins while automatically putting the processor into low-power deepsleep mode most of the time. Next step will be adding I/O (ble, sockets, mqtt, aws, perhaps mesh networks). We’ll see where this goes.*

*Hopefully some of this will be useful and ultimately incorporated into CircuitPython or similar setups.*

## CircuitPython on Linux and Orange Pi & more libgpiod

[![CircuitPython on Linux and Orange Pi & more libgpiod]({{ "/assets/06_124orange.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-orangepi-linux)

There are tons of projects, libraries and example code for CircuitPython on microcontrollers, and thanks to the flexibility and power of Python its pretty easy to get it working with micro-computers like Orange Pi or other ‘Linux with GPIO pins available’ single board computers. CircuitPython will be instantly and easily runnable on Linux computers like Orange Pi AND Thanks to libgpiod and Armbian we now have CircuitPython GPIO/i2c/SPI/UART for over 110+ CircuitPython libraries - [Adafruit Learning System.](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-orangepi-linux) Watch the video here - [YouTube.](https://youtu.be/sATjQRtuFTQ)

## Python on hardware history

[![Python on a chip]({{ "/assets/18_124pythonchip.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://code.google.com/archive/p/python-on-a-chip/)

A look back to some early Python on hardware.

PyMite is a flyweight Python interpreter written from scratch to execute on 8-bit and larger microcontrollers with resources as limited as 64 KiB of program memory (flash) and 4 KiB of RAM. PyMite supports a subset of the Python 2.5 syntax and can execute a subset of the Python 2.5 bytecodes. PyMite can also be compiled, tested and executed on a desktop computer - [PyMite wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyMite), [Google Code Archive](https://code.google.com/archive/p/python-on-a-chip/), and [python-on-a-chip mailing list.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-on-a-chip)

tinypy - 64k tinypy "batteries not (yet) included" was release in 2008 by Phil Hassey. tinypy is a minimalist implementation of python in 64k of code - [tinypy.org](http://www.tinypy.org/) & [GitHub.](https://github.com/philhassey/tinypy)

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/124hello.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord.](https://adafru.it/discord)

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too.](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human)
