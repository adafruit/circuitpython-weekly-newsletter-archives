Scott ([@tannewt](https://twitter.com/tannewt)), [CircuitPython](https://www.adafruit.com/circuitpython) project lead, was on [episode #383 of the Amp Hour](https://theamphour.com/383-an-interview-with-scott-shawcroft/). The Amp Hour podcast is a variety of discussion about electronics between hosts Chris Gammell and Dave Jones. Some episodes, such as #383, feature a special guest who brings a different perspective to the show.

In episode #383, Scott and Chris discuss a variety of CircuitPython related topics. They begin by discussing Scott's software engineering background and how he began working with Adafruit on MicroPython. Then, they go into details about debugging ARM chips (like the SAMD21 on Adafruit's M0 boards). Towards the end they discuss high level goals of the CircuitPython community.
