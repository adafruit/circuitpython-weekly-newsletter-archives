## Make It Move with Crickit Guide
![Make It Move with Crickit Guide]({{ "/assets/MakeItMove_crickit.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}

The easiest way to use motors in CircuitPython! A new guide on the [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/) called [Make It Move with Crickit](https://learn.adafruit.com/make-it-move-with-crickit) provides you with code in CircuitPython and Microsoft MakeCode to quickly use various motor types. If you're not sure what motor you want, there is a guide on various movements to help you choose. If you have never used certain motor types, there are pages on how each type of motor works. Once you've chosen your motor, you can cut and paste sample code to get you started. This is the first guide in a series of Make It guides to help you use your products.
