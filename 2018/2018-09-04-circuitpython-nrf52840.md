[We published a new guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-the-nrf52?view=all) that will take you through the process of building/compiling CircuitPython for the nRF52840 bluetooth LE chipset. CircuitPython for nRF52840 isn't even alpha, its pre-alpha! This is for bleeding-edge development and experimentation! Expect things to change, break, and not work as planned, that's why you're here :)

Mu, our favorite editor for Python has a cool ["Making Mu" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUxYn0aNJVk). Using a tool called [gourse,](http://gource.io/) it turned the commit history of Mu’s development on GitHub into a video...

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!
