Ladyada and Mr. Ladyada have been hard at work designing a multitude of uses for the upcoming
CRICKIT boards that are all powered by CircuitPython. CRICKIT is a helper board designed to make
robotics easy. Check out the [video playlist here! YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjF7R1fz_OOW4YvQEoRLmocKUuOgvI-wh).

## LEEKS!

![CRICKIT micro:bit LEEK]({{ "/assets/microleek.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}

With Circuit Playground Crickit happening, and the Feather Crickit PCBs on the way, its time to try making a micro:bit version! This time we went with a vertical SMT connector, needs a little silkscreen touch-up and we're not sure whether it makes sense to keep a speaker output (there's no DAC on the micro:bit) or replace it with a big/loud buzzer instead. Decisions, decisions!

## Upcoming events!

[San Diego Python Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pythonsd/events/246559162/) May 24th, 2018 - San Diego, CA, USA.

June 8th to June 10th, 2018 is the [PyLondinium](https://pylondinium.org/) conference in the UK, organised by PSF volunteers in the City of London. There are at least MicroPython sessions: [Micropython Gotchas](https://pylondinium.org/talk.html?talk_id=7) & [MicroPython used in industrial applications](https://pylondinium.org/talk.html?talk_id=15).

July 23rd to July 29th, 2018 is [EuroPython](https://ep2018.europython.eu/), a community conference with a [call for proposals until May 20th](https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/call-for-proposals/) on every aspect of Python: programming from novice to advanced levels, applications and frameworks, or how you have been involved in introducing Python into your organization.
