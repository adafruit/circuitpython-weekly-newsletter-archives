## Python on hardware snakes its way to DesignerCon, empowering artists, and more!

[![Art of electronics 00]({{ "/assets/00-1120art.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="372px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/11/15/fennec-toys-at-designercon-circuitpython-powered-art-designercon-fennectoys-dcon-dcon2018-dconapp-agimat-designercon/)

Every artist, like every programmer, was a beginner at one time. When we all start out, there are more possibilities than constraints, we break things, we experiment, we get the experiences needed ... to perhaps, one day, become an expert. Art is code, code is art, hardware designs blur the lines of it all - the art we make with code, with hardware, with pixels, are mirrors of what is inside our minds.

Some great CircuitPython powered art happened over the weekend. Bay Area artist Vanessa Di Tullio, who specializes in ceramic sculpture and designer art toys showed these great CircuitPython powered sculptures on custom boards at [DesignerCon](http://www.designercon.com/) at the Anaheim Convention Center (CA) at booth 1049 as “Fennec Toys”.

Also, a little commentary from Nina that we really enjoyed "Python is a strong language, easy to learn, already has success in education, and has the most incredible community. Students can choose to use their knowledge as a foundation to learn new languages and concepts, or continue on their Python journey."

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy.

## Time to Say Goodbye to Arduino and Go On to Micropython/ Adafruit Circuitpython? By Andreas Spiess

Andreas Spiess writes - "Python seems to be the fastest growing programming language. It is also widely used to program Raspberry Pis, and it is on the verge to become available on our small microcontrollers. Has the time come to leave the Arduino IDE and go on? Time for a closer look." - [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1miwCJtxeM)

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more ways to use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **114**!
