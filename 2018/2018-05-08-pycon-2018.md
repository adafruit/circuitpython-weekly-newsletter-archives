This week is [PyCon US 2018](https://us.pycon.org/2018/) in Cleveland starting tomorrow May 9th! It is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/), the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting [Python](https://www.python.org/). Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers. Adafruit is a sponsor, we'll see you in the goodie bag :)

Scott ([@tannewt](https://github.com/tannewt/)), Dan ([@dhalbert](https://github.com/dhalbert/)) and Kattni ([@kattni](https://github.com/kattni/)) will be there starting Thursday. We'll have at least one Open Space during the talks, [an AdaBox 006](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3697) at the [PyLadies Auction](https://us.pycon.org/2018/events/auction/) and a single sprint day to work on 3.0.0. Please catch us [on Discord](https:/adafru.it/discord) before and during PyCon for the latest meet up times.

## New stable CircuitPython release!

[CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython) has released [2.3.1](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/2.3.1) with a fix for file system corruption on the [CircuitPlayground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) when battery powered. It also includes `storage.erase_filesystem()` which makes it easier to recover from corruption.

## PLOT of the week!
