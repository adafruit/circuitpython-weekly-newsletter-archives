One core tenet of CircuitPython development is to be open with our community. Last summer our core team grew with the addition of Dan and Kattni so we decided to start a weekly meeting where we could all get on the same page. We decided to include the community as well so that everyone can see what's happening and choose to participate. Since then, its been a huge success! We regularly hear about awesome projects, coordinate improvements to CircuitPython and discuss core ideas within our community.

The meeting happens on [our Discord server](https://adafru.it/discord) every Monday at 11am Pacific / 2pm Eastern. Everyone is encouraged to participate.  We have four sections to the meeting: [State of CircuitPython](https://youtu.be/RQIeFU-1U-M?t=3m27s), [Hug Reports round robin](https://youtu.be/RQIeFU-1U-M?t=7m7s), [Status Updates round robin](https://youtu.be/RQIeFU-1U-M?t=17m59s), and [In the Weeds discussion](https://youtu.be/RQIeFU-1U-M?t=41m26s). It usually runs around an hour. Those who cannot make the time are welcome to post hug reports and status updates to tannewt on Discord to be read during the meeting. Folks can also to choose to "lurk" and simply listen in. Meetings are recorded and available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjF7R1fz_OOUvw7tMv45xjWp0ht8yNgg0). Notes with time codes are also available via a link in the video description. For an example, check out [this week's notes](https://gist.github.com/tannewt/a3e9cd422215274c7ea88f8f63396570).

Thanks to Ladyada and Adafruit for supporting open hardware, open software and open development. Thanks to the community for making it all fun and worthwhile. You all rock! See you [on Discord](https://adafru.it/discord) and in the weekly meeting.

## Coming Soon! Python powered Pi accessories

[![PiLora]({{ "/assets/918lora.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://adafru.it/discord)

We'd like to see a Raspberry Pi use LoRa and came up with this Radio+OLED bonnet: you get a radio module, 128x32 OLED, three buttons, and a variety of antenna pads.

[![Pi Crickit]({{ "/assets/918picrickit.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://adafru.it/discord)

And the Crickit for Raspberry Pi is almost ready too :)

Both of these will have CircuitPython code when we ship.
