[![CircuitPython 3 logo]({{ "/assets/circuitpython300a.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/3.0.0-rc.0)

CircuitPython 3.0.0 is just around the corner and you can be one of the first to try it! We've released the first release candidate, [3.0.0-rc.0](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/3.0.0-rc.0). This is the best version of CircuitPython yet and barring any major new bugs, it will soon be marked stable. So, please help us test it to make sure it's as awesome as we want it to be.

3.0.0 adds support for the SAMD51 microcontroller present on the  [Metro M4 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3382), [ItsyBitsy M4 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800) and more M4 boards to come. These new boards provide the best CircuitPython experience yet. They feature a significantly faster CPU and more RAM so larger programs are possible and all programs run faster. In 3.0.0 we've also improved CircuitPython on the M0 by more intelligently using the RAM we have. Check [the release notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/3.0.0-rc.0) for a larger list of improvements.

As always, thank you to everyone who has helped build CircuitPython and it's community into the awesome project it is.

Adafruit CircuitPython Weekly for June 18th, 2018 [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/whU_QRlOk2I)

## CRICKITs of the week!

![MORE COWBELL]({{ "/assets/cowbell.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}

Don't fear the CRICKIT "more cowbell" robot. On start up, directs users that cowbell is very important, uses rotary knob to increase the frequency of striking the cowbell, the NeoPixels indicate green for good and red, more cowbell. A fun hack controls a fog machine, and the ending is as you may have guessed, still needs more cowbell - [video](https://youtu.be/sjisA9-YyrM) & [code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/master/Crickits/dont_fear_the_crickit/code.py).

All our times have come

Here but now they're gone

Seasons don't fear the reaper

Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain, we can be like they are

![ROBOT ARM]({{ "/assets/robotarm.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}

Robot Arm CRICKIT. Testing a sample we were sent of a robot arm, not going to stock these arms, however, good experimenting - [code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/master/Crickits/robot_arm/code.py) & [video](https://youtu.be/tVDJx2F_bMg).
