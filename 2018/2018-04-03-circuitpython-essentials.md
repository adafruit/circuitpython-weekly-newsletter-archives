Hot off the digital press! The [CircuitPython Essentials Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials) is the one stop shop for learning CircuitPython basics. Each page explains a basic concept with an example that works for all of our CircuitPython boards including the newest one, the [Itsy Bitsy M0 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3727)!

As you may have noticed, we've revamped the Python for Microcontrollers newsletter to include more content each week! In every newsletter we'll have a link to a featured story or guide. Furthermore, will have a host of CircuitPython, MicroPython and Python news from the week. We'll be sending this now every Tuesday and are accepting suggestions all week through the [newsletter's GitHub repository](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-weekly-newsletter). Let us know what cool things you are doing with Python!
