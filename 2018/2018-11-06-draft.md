## The Python powered synth is here

[![Blinka plays the blues]({{ "/assets/0111-6blinknt.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4020)

The NeoTrellis M4 is a python powered musical synth and more. It's is an all-in-one USB + NeoPixel + Elastomer + Audio board. It's powered by our new favoritest-chip-in-the-world, the SAMD51, a Cortex M4 core running at 120 MHz. 

[![NeoTrellis]({{ "/assets/0211-6nt.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neotrellis-m4?view=all)

This chip has a speedy core with CircuitPython and Arduino support, hardware DSP/floating point, dual DACs (more on that later!) and all the goodies you expect from normal chips like I2C, ADC, DMA, etc. It has a roomy 512KB of flash and 192KB of SRAM so it's great for CircuitPython, we added a full 8MB flash chip so tons of space for files and audio clips - [NeoTrellis M4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4020), [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neotrellis-m4?view=all), and [videos.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjF7R1fz_OOViOTN2ezorIIZL1PJF6nvE)

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Check back next week for more CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **105**!

## Upcoming events!

[![CT Hackerspace]({{ "/assets/1511-6ct.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/256072526/)

CT Hackerspace hosts ‚ÄòScaling Up with CircuitPython‚Äô FREE Workshop Thursday 11/15. Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the hobbyist community. It is easy to learn and has strong community support. It is used for a variety of tasks from AI to server administration and now even to run microcontrollers.

CircuitPython is becoming a great alternative to programming microcontrollers and is built specifically to do so. It simplifies the process of writing code for your board and gives quick results. We will be looking at programming the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express with CircuitPython. We will also take a look at what boards are available.
