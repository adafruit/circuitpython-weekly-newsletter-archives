## Happy holidays - Thank you from the Python on microcontroller authors, and all of Adafruit!

[![Happy holidays and thank you from Adafruit 01]({{ "/assets/01_1225happy.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://youtu.be/_qf6spf090A)

Thank you to all the readers who susbribe and read this newsletter every week. Today happens to be Christmas Day and we set the newsletter to be sent out as usual to keep up with all the things happening in the world of Python on hardware. We'll have one next week as well, which just happens to be New Years Day!

It's been a fantastic year for Python on hardware and we appreciate all the support to keep doing this. We're up to [2 years](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/) of publishing and over 4,000+ subscribers already, the entire Adafruit team and community thanks you! - [Video](https://youtu.be/_qf6spf090A).

## CircuitPython in 2019

[![CircuitPython in 2019 02]({{ "/assets/02_1225cpc.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/17/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2019-circuitpython2019-circuitpython/)

As 2018 comes to a close we like to reflect on how the year went and set goals for 2019. In the last two years ([2017](https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/01/09/welcome-to-the-adafruit-circuitpython-beta/), [2018](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/01/29/circuitpython-in-2018/)) this has been a blog post by Scott (aka tannewt). For 2019, we’d like to do it a bit differently. This time we’d like everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the Internet.

We’ll read these over the holidays and into the first half of January. After the January 14th CircuitPython weekly we’ll draft an overarching vision post for CircuitPython in 2019 and discuss it in the following meeting.

See [the blog post for more details](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/17/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2019-circuitpython2019-circuitpython/).

## Made with Mu, not that Mu, the other one

One thing we did not know is that Mu, the Python one, has [turtle](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu_tkinter) [built in](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu_portable_python_macos), this means you can use it to make excellent art and more.

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **119**!

[![Languages 24]({{ "/assets/hello1225.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).
