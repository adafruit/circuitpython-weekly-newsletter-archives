On [August 3, 2018](https://twitter.com/awesome__re/status/1025240714718797824) - [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-circuitpython) was added to the [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), a community of curated awesome lists on GitHub. The hugely popular project is looking for more awesome people to help maintain the list. Go [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/1363) to help. Additionally, [Sindre Sorhus](https://www.patreon.com/sindresorhus/overview), the awesome list maintainer, has a Patreon if you want to support all their open source efforts. Adafruit contributes to the Patreon.

The 2018 Top Programming Languages - "A nice aspect of using Python this way is that it is very handy in [certain applications](https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/build-an-illuminated-halloween-costume-with-the-wearable-gemma-m0-microcontroller) to play with attached hardware via an interactive prompt or dynamically reload scripts on the fly. Growing into a new domain can only help boost Pythonâ€™s popularity." - [spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/the-2018-top-programming-languages.amp.html).
