## I scream, you scream, we all scream for Python

[![Scream for Python]({{ "/assets/scream731.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://youtu.be/J3U4hcvJnmI)

When Edvard Munch painted his most famous painting, The Scream, in 1893 he perfectly captured the existential angst of modern humanity. He did not, however, have access to a microcontroller board with built-in sound sensing, connected to a servo motor and speaker, so he failed to make his masterpiece interactive.

Using the Crickit with Circuit Playground Express, and a bit of code in CircuitPython, we can make The Scream scream back at you when you scream at it! - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/the-scream-munch-screaming-interactive-scream-painting?view=all) & [video](https://youtu.be/J3U4hcvJnmI).

## News from around the web!

This is follow up from a previous newsletter item, the code is up. e-Paper Display driver code for Circuitpython with a fractal demo, it draws a Julia or Mandlebrot fractal on the display. This code was written and tested on an Adafruit Metro M4 running Circuitpython 3.0. The e-Paper displays are the monochrome SPI varieties from Waveshare. Six digital I/O pins are required - [GitHub](https://github.com/gpshead/epaper-circuitpython).

The EuroPython Conference videos from last week have been posted - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/PythonItalia/videos).

[Post Mu 1.0.0 release](https://codewith.mu/), Hacker News picked it up and the lead developer [ntoll](https://twitter.com/ntoll) answered some questions in the comments, if you're interested on how some of Mu works, motivations, and more, check it out - [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17638067). Looks like a tag line for Mu has arrived from the comments - "Python is a language that helps make code readable, Mu is an editor to help make code writable."

Speaking of Mu (and EuroPython!) Mu was used in the opening conference keynote by Pythonista-extraordinaire [David Beazley](http://dabeaz.com/). Here's why - "From a more practical point of view, I choose to use Mu for my talk precisely because it was extremely simple. I do a lot of live-coding in talks and for that, I usually try to keep the environment minimal. [â€¦] Part of the appeal of Mu is that I could code and use the REPL without cluttering the screen with any other unnecessary cruft. For example, I could use it without having to switch between terminal windows and I could show code and its output at the same time in a fairly easy way." - [MadeWith.mu](https://madewith.mu/mu/users/2018/07/30/keynoting-mu.html) & [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsvmT2Ir7B8&feature=youtu.be&t=26m).
