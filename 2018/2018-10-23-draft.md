## Arduino to CircuitPython

[![Arduino to CircuitPython]({{ "/assets/01_1023_arduino.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://learn.adafruit.com/arduino-to-circuitpython?view=all/)

By popular demand - [Arduino to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/arduino-to-circuitpython?view=all). There are several ways to program microcontrollers. Some methods are more difficult than others and this can often depend on how much familiarity someone has with programming basics.

This guide is primarily for Arduino developers to learn the ins and outs of using CircuitPython by demonstrating use of program code in both languages. This may be a reference for people as they get comfortable in their CircuitPython skills.

Just as valid could be the Python or CircuitPython programmer who has never used Arduino before. Showing the code that Arduino uses for various things may help to become more comfortable with the Arduino environment.

We'll be updating the guide and adding more - [check it out!](https://learn.adafruit.com/arduino-to-circuitpython?view=all)

## CircuitPython powered keyboards

[![MiniKbd]({{ "/assets/02_1023minikbd.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.tindie.com/products/andyclymer/minikbd-little-diy-keyboard-kit-for-the-trinket/)

The [MiniKbd](https://github.com/andyclymer/minikbd) is a USB device based on the Adafruit Trinket M0 development board [by](https://twitter.com/andyclymer/with_replies) [Andy Clymer](http://www.andyclymer.com/), available on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/andyclymer/minikbd-little-diy-keyboard-kit-for-the-trinket/).

[![MiniKbd]({{ "/assets/04_1023endc.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.tindie.com/products/andyclymer/minikbd-little-diy-keyboard-kit-for-the-trinket/)

The MiniKbd is programmable with CircuitPython - each key can be easily customized to perform any combination of keystrokes or mouse movement. When plugging it in over USB, your computer will recognize it as a “USB HID” (Human Interface Device), as if a keyboard or mouse had been plugged in. The keystrokes that are output by the MiniKbd can then be configured by editing the CircuitPython code running on the device.

[The KernTroller](https://github.com/andyclymer/kerntroller) is a customizable keyboard controller with pressure sensitive capacitive touch pads, based on the Adafruit Trinket M0 board, and is programmable with CircuitPython.

Andy also has some [CircuitPython helper libs](https://github.com/andyclymer/circuitpython_libs).

## New Learn Guides!

[![learn.adafruit.com]({{ "/assets/18_1023learn.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

[learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/) has a refresh and more! We got rid of the random, unorganized landing page and its masonry design. We now offer a much more curated experience which should help you discover new guides.

[![CircuitPython on learn]({{ "/assets/19_1023circpy.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://learn.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython)

Our catalog of guides has grown to almost 2000 guides, so naturally some of the older guides have gotten buried. With this new design we hope to bring some of these great old guides back in the spotlight with guide groups. These are hand curated groups of guides based on a theme like 3d printing, robots, no soldering required, beginner, etc.

There is also a new hero system that will bring attention to a constantly changing set of our favorite guides. So check back often!

We have even more great new features for the Adafruit Learning System under development, and can’t wait to share them with you.

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **104**!
