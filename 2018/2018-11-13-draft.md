## Python powers costumes, and community

[![WAKANDA!]({{ "/assets/01-1113blackpanther.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://twitter.com/bossjones/status/1061426671914500098)

Malcon has been posting progress on a wonderful CircuitPython powered Black Panter costume - [Malcolm Jones on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/bossjones/status/1061426671914500098) Like cosplay/costuming, Python comes bundled with community - from events, to meet ups, and a spectrum of begineers to profressionals - Python is a dynamic programming language which has the added benefit of people sharing experiences together. As we develop Python "tuned" for hardware, we thought about how folks would use it, real people, making and sharing real things. With CircuitPython, our begineer-friendly Python for micro-controllers, it was important for it to be both powerful and simple, all at the same time so people could spend time on doing things they wanted to do. The CircuitPython device shows up as a USB drive, the code can be edited and viewed with any text editor, including a phone-on-the-go, when saved - the device "runs" immediately and the results are real-time. For development, this cuts down time to minutes and seconds, from hours and days. You're not compiling and wait, your making. When you're creating a costume, or any type of project, minor, frequent, and subtle changes are needed, fast iteration is the difference between it being fun, or being abandoned completely. Prince T'Challa's Black Panther suit is made powereful by the Vibranium found in Wakanda, in this world, we can use Python.

## Make some noise with Python

PyDev of the Week: Frank Vieira from [Mouse vs Python](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2018/11/12/pydev-of-the-week-frank-vieira/)

## Made with Mu

[![Made with Mu]({{ "/assets/11-1113mu.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](ttps://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/698)

Ben is working on something [pretty interesting](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/698) ... "I'm working with @flexiondotorg and @waveform80 on publishing a [snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(package_manager)) for [Mu](https://codewith.mu/), which will make it easy to install Mu across Linux distributions and potentially Windows and Mac in future. When a snap is published in the [snapcraft store](https://snapcraft.io/), Mu will be installable with snap install mu-editor and will bundle all dependencies, including Python, QT and all python libs. We will introduce a snapcraft.yml into the root of the project. This will contain the spec for how the snap is built." - via [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/ben_nuttall/status/1059956595549970432)

Over on the mu-editor/general gitter, looks like some more board support is coming soon - "Nicholas Tollervey @ntoll - Nov 09 09:57 @CleoQc yup... so Mu currently targets Adafruit boards, micro:bit, PyGameZero and "standard" Python 3. We're going to be adding a "MicroPython" mode to target boards specifically designed for that (PyBoard and ESP8266 etc), also a Kano mode, for their upcoming products. We also have Caliope mode in the works (a micro:bit spin off from Germany) and I'm going to add a "Web" mode for making simple dynamic web applications. All this coming in release 1.1 (as soon as I can clear my diary). ;-)"

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **112**!
