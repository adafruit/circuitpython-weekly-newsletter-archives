## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I finished the secondary USB serial implementation and it was merged.

For the past couple of days, I've been working on an idiosyncrasy of the RP2040 I2C hardware: it cannot do zero-length writes, which we use for I2C bus scanning, and for device probing. MicroPython uses its bitbang I2C implementation for such writes. I tried the same thing and discovered an issue with `bitbangio.I2C` on our RP2040 port. It turned out to be some glitches caused when changing state in `DigitalInOut`. With those fixed, `bitbangio.I2C` now works fine, and `busio.I2C.scan()` also works. There is still some issue when substituting `bitbangio.I2C for the zero-length writes, and I'm tracking it down.

**Jeff**

The guide I mentioned last week, showing how to use the RP2040's PIO to drive 8 strands of neopixels has been published, [check it out](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopio-drive-lots-of-leds-with-raspberry-pi-pico).

I've continued to learn more about the RP2040's PIO module, beginning to adapt more of [the examples](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/pio/) to CircuitPython and ultimately create a guide that will serve as an introduction to PIO using CircuitPython.

Some of them, like "Differential Manchester Encoding", are probably quite interesting to the right person, but not likely to be used by very many people. Others, like uart_rx, can't be done without some improvements to the core of CircuitPython. We'll pick and choose what's most interesting and useful to cover in this guide, so feel free to let me know your opinion on our Discord.

The way many of them work only becomes clear after repeatedly reading the code. This makes me think someone should create a PIO emulator & debugger.

This week I ran into an issue across the libraries with Pylint. Pylint is something we use to make sure all of our code is a standard format. A recent update made a previously ignored check begin working, and the way we write examples triggered the check. So, I needed to change how Pylint is run on the examples so it could still check them for other formatting, but not trigger this specific check. As we were already working on changing the logistics behind how we run Pylint, we decided to bump that process up and do both at once. All kudos goes to @Hugo on Discord for providing the update. Dylan will be running an Adabot patch this week and, once all the libraries are updated, our builds should begin passing again. Thank you to our contributors for their patience while we sorted out the best solution to this issue.

Around sorting out the Pylint issue, I also updated the [BMP388 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bmp388-bmp390-bmp3xx) for the STEMMA QT revision, and created a couple of Fritzing objects for that and another new product.

This past week I've been working on low power on the STM32. Low power states and APIs are something that vary quite a lot between chip vendors - the ESP32, STM32 and Nordic APIs for low power are all quite different, which makes fitting them in the same Alarm module an interesting problem. I've been factoring out parts of the STM32 code that were previously packed into other modules, like external pin interrupts in PulseIO and the RTC in Port, so they can now be used for low power purposes. I'm also wrangling with the parts of the ESP32-S2 code that are a little convoluted, like the systems for simulating sleep when USB is connected, and the means by which wakeup alarms are returned from light vs deep sleep.

This past week was both a very busy one for me and a very fun one. First of all, I started off by writing an implementation of the fromisoformat() for the CircuitPython datetime library. The tricky part for this was when I started enabling unit tests. While I originally intended on doing a partial implementation, it turned out that this wasn't very far from a full implementation, so that's what I ended up doing.

After that, I wrote my first eInk display driver. The tricky part of writing eInk drivers over TFT drivers is you don't get much feedback until they are most of the way there. I ended up hooking up a logic analyzer just to make sure the data that was being passed in was good. Once I got it updating, it was usually only a matter of tweaking a few settings to get it to look right. I also updated the gizmo library to work with the new size of display.

Finally I finished up the week with working on the issue with the Mini Pi TFT displays on the Raspberry Pi. I started out with testing some changes to the ST7789 display and ended up updating the driver so that it would do the offsets correctly in the various rotations. One of the tricky parts of these displays is depending on the size, it uses a different part of the display.

I came up with a good way of calculating the offset without a lot of fancy logic. This was also the furthest I've gotten into writing a driver and I just need to get everything packaged up and we should have the problem solved soon.

This week I've finally got I2SOut and PDMIn ready to merge in along with a number of improvements for the PIO on the RP2040. The PR is [here](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/4251).

I also knocked out a few minor issues on the RP2040 while I was at it. One thing I did was factor out the flash size so that it can vary between boards. (Perfect timing because Pimoroni just merged in definitions for three of their boards.) I'm reviewing PRs for countio and busio.UART on the RP2040. I'm also advising on work to support pulseio.PulseIn (which is used for DHT sensors.)

My next thing is adding rotaryio support which is used for rotary encoders (knobs that can rotate 360+ degrees rather than just over a range.)
