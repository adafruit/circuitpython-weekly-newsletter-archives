## Building With CircuitPython Podcast

[![Building With CircuitPython](../assets/20210831/20210831pod.jpg)](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/75/)

[![Building With CircuitPython](../assets/20210831/20210831pod2.jpg)](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/75/)

The Real Python Podcast presents *Building With CircuitPython & Constraints of Python for Microcontrollers with the lead developer of CircuitPython* with Scott Shawcroft at Adafruit - [Real Python Podcast](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/75/).  

> Can you make a version of Python that fits within the memory constraints of a microcontroller and have it still feel like Python? That is the intention behind CircuitPython. This week on the show, we have Scott Shawcroft, who is the project lead for CircuitPython.  <br><br>
We talk about all things CircuitPython. While working with the language on several projects I have developed many of my own questions to ask Scott. Scott answers my questions about boot loaders, packages, the bundle, and bluetooth low energy (BLE).  <br><br>
He also talks about the struggle of fitting the language and board specific libraries within tiny memory constraints. We discuss projects and boards for beginners, and many resources to learn more.

## Linux Turns 30

[![Linux Turns 30](../assets/20210831/20210831linux2.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/08/25/linux-is-30-years-old-today-linux-opensource-linus__torvalds/)

## New Learn Guides!

There were no new Learn guides this week. Keep an eye out here for more lovely guides next week!

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210831/20210831bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210831/20210831pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210831/20210831pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210831/20210831pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210831/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Last week I improved audio playing on SAMD chips, adapting the changes I had made to improve RP2040 audio. The way DMA works on the two chips is quite different, but in the end I was able to figure out how to get the information I needed about which DMA transfer had just completed.

I released CircuitPython 7.0.0-beta.0 on Monday, August 23. Immediately someone found a usb_hid bug for me to fix, but it was quick to find the fix. We expect to be issuing another beta soon. We only have about ten issues to resolve for 7.0.0, down from about two dozen the previous week.

It's been more bug squashing. In the past week, the bug I was happiest to squash was one which limited the usability of the `microcontroller.nvm` on esp32-s2 boards. Before, the module didn't quite behave the same as on other boards, could only store a few hundred bytes, and you could even get stuck without the ability to update the contents of nvm! now, you can store 8kB and should never get stuck without the ability to update.

The downside is that any nvm settings from 6.3 will be lost when you upgrad to 7.0, and 6.3 won't be able to read settings stored by 7.

This week I've been working on two guides. One for the SCD-4x CO2 sensors, and one for MP3 playback on RP2040. Expect to see both of those completed very soon. 

Next up after that is updating the INA219 guide for the STEMMA QT revision of the board, and a guide for the PAM8302 amplifier, which won't be out until the MP3 guide is out because the example in that guide will be used in the PAM guide.

I also did a lot of testing with the CO2 sensors to verify they work properly on Raspberry Pi, CircuitPython and Arduino. The sensors work great. My air quality? Apparently not so great.

This past week I focused on implementing a new interface for the CircuitPython Code Editor. Getting the initial look implemented was pretty straight forward, but learning the intricacies of the JavaScript based controls enough to style and manipulate them has been the bigger challenge. Also, working on a design that functions in both the desktop and mobile environments was a bit challenging as well. It should be in a state for people to play around with soon.

This week I did some testing of the BLE workflow. I made two tweaks to it as a result. First, I changed directory delete to be recursive. This makes it much quicker to delete a non-empty directory. Second, I changed the auto reload to wait after a write so that the BLE client has a chance to start a second command before the BLE connection is reset.

Besides that I've been bug hunting.
* I enabled unicode filename support in CP and tweaked string repr to print emojis instead of escaping them.
* I fixed USB on iMX RT which was broken due to sleeping while we needed to do something for USB.
* I fixed I2C allocation on RP2040 so that pins don't need to be next to one another.
* I added multiple status dotstar support (useful for Funhouse.)
* I fixed an ESP32-S2 crash when using an I2CDisplay.

This next week will be a similar mix of BLE work and bug hunting.
