An informative thread on Twitter, starting with x-rays of the new Raspberry Pi Pico board and subsequently going layer by layer through the board’s RP2040 chip. The die shots are both beautiful and informative in understanding this new chip. The thread indicates the chip is made in 40nm and at the TSMC fab - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/01/29/die-shots-of-the-raspberry-pi-rp2040-chip-teardown-dieshot-reverseengineering-piday-johndmcmaster-raspberry_pi/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johndmcmaster/status/1355092011829719046) with [zoomable image](https://siliconpr0n.org/map/raspberry-pi/rp2-b0/mz_mit20x/).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210202/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **290**!

**New Libraries!**

Here's this week's new CircuitPython libraries:

 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_PIOASM](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PIOASM)
 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_AW9523](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_AW9523)

**Updated Libraries!**

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I made a CircuitPython 6.2.0-beta.0 release last week, and just today (written 1/27) released 6.2.0-beta.1. These releases include support for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 chip. Thanks, Scott, for that port!

In beta.1 I made it a lot easier to enable and disable json, re, and other modules that we inherited from MicroPython but haven't yet incorporated into the CircuitPython style of coding native modules. I also cleaned up the documentation for those modules, removing the MicroPython ujson and ure style of naming.

I continued to work on the mysterious slow files writes issue. I have a fix but it's fixing the symptom rather than the underlying problem, so we'll try to find the root cause.

As I may have mentioned before, the next significant project I'll be working on is a secondary CDC (serial) USB channel. This will allow easy serial communication with a host computer without worrying about the REPL and things like ctrl-C getting in the way.

**Jeff**

This past week, I created a MagTag project to show the poem that Amanda Gorman read at the Inaguration, showing one new line every hour.  To make it work how I wanted, I wrote a function to precisely wrap text according to its width in pixels.  Discord's FoamyGuy (Tim) has stepped up and plans to bring this feature to a future version of the adafruit_display_text library.  I wrote more about it [on my blog](https://emergent.unpythonic.net/01611420170).

[![Jeff](../assets/20210202/20210202jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I also updated the "Protomatter" library for RGBMatrix.  This version adds support for stacked or "tiled" displays-For instance, you can now take 4 64x32 displays, arrange them as two rows of two, and use them as a virtual 128x64 display. This feature is in the first 6.2 alpha release.  An update to the matrixportal library and the guide page are on the way as well.

[![Jeff](../assets/20210202/20210202jeff2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

**Kattni**

I worked on a lot of miscellaneous this week, as we spent the week getting caught up with RP2040 launch whatnot. I updated the MPR121 guide to include the STEMMA QT revision, and everything that goes with that such as new wiring diagrams and images. I created a repo for a new CircuitPython library called DisplayIO_Layout that will initially be populated with a grid layout concept from @foamyguy and @kmatch98. I used the base code in a personal project and I'm really looking forward to it being available as a library for others to use. I fixed up a couple of wiring diagrams that were done up wrong. I merged a PR from a community contributor on the CircuitPlayground library to add further configuration for tap, and then removed some unnecessary code now that we have CircuitPython 6.x stable and beta in play. Finally, I've been keeping up with questions on Discord regarding the new Pico and its RP2040 chip as folks are getting their new boards and trying them out with CircuitPython.

**Lucian**

This past week, I've been debugging Socket, moving through a list of new issues and concerns as more people get their hands on the module and start testing. I also took a little time to get up to date on the features of the newly revealed RP2040, and have gotten some new low power monitoring tools, so I'm looking forward to contributing to those projects as well.

**Melissa**

This past week I mostly worked on closing a variety of GitHub issues and reviewing some GitHub Pull Requests. I also took a look at Home Assistant and figuring out what is required to get some of our sensors working. I ended up using CircuitPython to publish messages directly to MQTT and added a device into the configuration. I will be working on writing a guide, so keep an eye out for that.

**Scott**

This week was a whirlwind with the launch of the RP2040. I've been answering lots of questions continuing to do a bunch of reviews.

My next goal is to add audio playback support to the RP2040. It's been a bit slow to get my brain back in audio mode but I hope to have something playing for Friday's stream. (I'm hoping to knock out PWM and I2S output.)
