[![ulab updates](../assets/20210119/20210119ulab.jpg)](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/tree/legacy)

Two new versions of ulab, a numpy-like number crunching library, have been released. These versions implements a numpy-compatible interface, and adds a couple of new functions, as well as a number of fixes for bugs while writing the manual. The change in the interface was a recurring request from the community and is meant to simplify porting of numpy code from a PC. Since CircuitPython is still using the old interface, the fixes have been backported and released as v.1.7.1. The CircuitPython-compatible version is going to stay alive on the [legacy branch](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/tree/legacy), and will receive regular updates and bug fixes until CircuitPython decides to adopt the numpy-compatible interface - [GitHub](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/tree/legacy).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

In the past week I fixed many bugs in preparation for 6.1.0-rc.1, including two bugs related to time.sleep(), an AnalogOut bug on SAMD51, a SAMD PWMOut bug, and some fixes for BLE timing values. I have some other fixes in the works but will probably hold them for a 6.1.1 release so we can get 6.1.0 final out the door.

I've also been experimenting with very inexpensive Bluetooth thermometer/hygrometers from Xiaomi. I can connect to them and get data, and it's also possible to install unofficial custom firmware that adds many features.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20210119/20210119jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

After many delays, the main branch now supports I2S audio output on the ESP32-S2. In this quick demo from Show & Tell, you can press one of the 4 buttons on this e-ink display to play the associated wave file.

**Kattni**

This week I did some general guide work, including fixing up a couple of guides that had minor issues. One needed a different schematic and fab print, and another needed an extra Fritzing diagram.

I worked with Dylan on getting the majority of libraries updated to using the latest Black. There were a couple of updates to the templates we use for creating libraries that needed to be applied to all libraries before they were added to the templates, so Dylan did that in the same process. This ended up involving manually adding new license formatting to all of the existing libraries, and therefore PRs for all of them. We're still working through this project, but so far we're over halfway through.

**Lucian**

This week I've been ironing out the issues with the server bindings of the Socket layer, specifically by the receive, accept and connect functions non-blocking (so they don't make Circuitpython hang as they run). I've been implementing new timeout features across the API and adding the corresponding error codes, as well as making sure that functions like recv_into and send can be used across various different kinds of sockets.

I've also been part of an ongoing investigation into why the ESP32-S2 has different AnalogOut behavior from the ESP32. I'd gotten some pointers from Espressif late last year, but as more people have encountered the problem it's become clear that things are still confusing. I'm hoping to get more info from them on the specific differences between the two chip lines, and the intent behind the calibration differences I've seen in the IDF code.

**Melissa**

This past week I worked with Jeff to get a workaround in place for an issue that came up with a recent kernel release for the Raspberry Pi which resulted in a garbled screen. The workaround will basically roll back the kernel to an older version before the issue came up.

I also finished a big project of getting the PyPortal refactored to use PortalBase and kept full backwards compatibility with the previous library. This is a project that I had started before the holiday break and I had to come up with some workarounds that I was getting stuck on. I ended up refactoring PortalBase slightly to make it easier, but in a way that I didn't need to go back and update the MagTag and MatrixPortal libraries.

The other thing I did was I ported all of the WebSerial and WebBluetooth work from glitch over to GitHub pages. The repositories were all set up already, so this mostly involved enabling GitHub pages on each repo and updating the paths, though I did run into one issue where the CSS was missing. Copying it from glitch and uploading it to GitHub fixed that issue.

This week I've been keeping up with all of the pull request reviews and support for CircuitPython. So, lots of odds and ends.

I did my first stream of the year where we went and looked back at past CircuitPython annual plans. See [the stream here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh7umSOoMqo). I'll be drafting my own post this week!
