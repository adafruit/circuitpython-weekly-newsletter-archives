## CircuitPython 7.0.0 Now Available

[![CircuitPython 7.0.0](../assets/20210921/20210921cp7.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/09/20/circuitpython-7-0-0-released/)

CircuitPython 7.0.0 is now available as the new stable release! 

Notable additions to 7.0.0 since 6.3.0 include:

* Support for the CircuitPython development workflow over BLE.
* Camera support on ESP32-S2.
* `qrio`: QR code decoding.
* The keypad key-scanning module.
* Run-time customization of USB devices.
* Merging in of MicroPython fixes and enhancements as of MicroPython 1.16.
* `_pixelbuf` is now `adafruit_pixelbuf`.
* `colorwheel()` routine moved to `rainbowio`.
* `supervisor.ticks_ms()` to allow easier time-keeping.
* Simplifications to the RGB status LED codes.
* A clocking fix for a few samples of RP2040 boards.
* Rework of `vectorio` and some of its API. `VectorShape` is no longer needed for user code.
* `atexit` module.
* `getpass` module.
* `traceback` module.
* `supervisor.get_previous_traceback()`.
* board.LED now consistently present on all boards that have such an LED.
* `PulseOut` no longer needs a `PWMOut`.
* Unicode filename support.
* Board ID is now in boot_out.txt and available as board.board_id.
* `aesio` on for full builds by default.

**Port status**

CircuitPython has a number of “ports” that are the core implementations for different microcontroller families. Stability varies on a per-port basis. As of this release, `atmel-samd`, `cxd56` (Spresense), `esp32s2`, `nrf`, `raspberrypi`, `stm` for the F4 family are stable. `stm` for other STM chip families is being actively improved but may be missing functionality and have bugs. `litex` and `mimxrt10xx` are in an alpha state and will have bugs and missing functionality.

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210921/20210921bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210921/20210921pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210921/20210921pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210921/20210921pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210921/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **333**!

**Updated Libraries!**

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I fixed a few more minor issues for 7.0.0 final, and released 7.0.0-rc.2. 7.0.0-rc.2 turned out to have a regression for RP2040 boards, and we are releasing an rc.3 to fix that.

**Jeff**

I'm still getting back into the swing of things after a vacation (you may have read about my visit to Adafruit HQ in last week's issue). Today was working on preparing a version of a rather subtle pair of bugfixes to the garbage collector to go into micropython, since this is code shared between the two projects.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Adafruit IS31FL3741 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-is31fl3741/). It has everything you need to get started using your IS31FL3741 LED matrix driver breakout, including Pinouts, examples for CircuitPython and Arduino, and Downloads resources. If you're looking to get sparkly with your new IS31FL3741, check out this guide!

Up next are any one of the following guides: Proximity Trinkey, ANO rotary encoder, or PAM8302. Find out soon which one!

**Melissa**

This past week, I worked on fixing up some Raspberry Pi related issues including fixing an issue with some displays where the backlight wasn't turning on automatically leaving a black display. It had been a while since I had worked on the eInk display guides, so I created another one for 2.9" eInk displays. You can check it out at https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-9-eink-display-breakouts-and-featherwings.

**Scott**

This last week has had three threads I've been working on. First, I wrapped up the BLE workflow changes to add modification times and file moving. Second, I started reworking CircuitPython in preparation for expanding ESP support to the ESP32-S3. Unexpected Maker has picked up that work from me and is continuing it. The latest thing I'm working on is bringing TinyUSB support to the Raspberry Pi 4. This will be a building block for CircuitPython on the Raspberry Pi 4. I hope it will also extend to the whole Raspberry Pi range without too much trouble once I have it working on one chip. I believe the USB peripheral itself is pretty similar across the whole line. It's the CPUs that change more.
