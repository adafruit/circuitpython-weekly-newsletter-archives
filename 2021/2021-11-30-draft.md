## Cooperative Multitasking Added to CircuitPython 7 Beta

[![CircuitPython 7](../assets/20211130/20211130cp7.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/cooperative-multitasking-in-circuitpython/overview)

[![Cooperative Multitasking](../assets/20211130/20211130async.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/cooperative-multitasking-in-circuitpython/overview)

Cooperative multitasking is now in CircuitPython, using the `asyncio` library and the `async` and `await` language keywords. The `asyncio` library is included with CPython, the host-computer version of Python. MicroPython also supplies a version of `asyncio`, and that version has been adapted for use in CircuitPython - [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/cooperative-multitasking-in-circuitpython/overview).

## Gom Jabbar from Dune with Raspberry Pi

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were no new boards added, but several are in development.

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20211130/20211130bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20211130/20211130pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20211130/20211130pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20211130/20211130pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20211130/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

The *Cooperative Multitasking in CircuitPython* guide I wrote is now live. I have more sections to write, but the guide contains a number of simple examples which will help you get started using `asyncio`, `async`, and `await` in CircuitPython.

**Jeff**

After a week off, I'm back and working on bug fixing. I found and fixed a few bugs in the dither & blend functions I added a few weeks ago, and in the process of doing so I also made it possible to test and debug the bitmaptools routines directly on a host computer. Another bugs I fixed was a problem with writing `boot_out.txt` on a freshly erased CIRCUITPY drive.

This week, I continued work on the Feather ESP32-S2 guide. At least part of it went live because folks were looking for the info it contains. I did a lot of testing and ended up doing my first Adafruit IO project for this one. Keep an eye out for that and the rest of the guide!

Next up is the guide for the KB2040.

This past week was a little bit shorter for me. I started working on a new project for a Learn Guide that uses CircuitPython to control a laser using a Nunchuk controller. Keep an eye out for the upcoming guide.

Last week I polished the broadcom (Raspberry Pi) work to the point that I could propose to have the code in CircuitPython main. After a prompt review from Dan, it's been merged! While I was waiting, I also added basic I2C functionality. I've got more polish to do next week to support more I2C peripherals, UARTs and SPIs. I'll also need to add it to circuitpython.org/downloads as well. Overall, the support is still early and will have bugs. I'd call it alpha state. I hope that by getting more folks trying it, more folks will help bug hunt it.
