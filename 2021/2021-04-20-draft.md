Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## CircuitPython now available for 200 boards!

[![200 boards!](../assets/20210420/20210420200.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

There are now 200 boards that support CircuitPython! The [Slide Trinkey - SAMD21](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_slide_trinkey_m0/) is board number 200. 

[![200 boards!](../assets/20210420/20210420downloads200.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

CircuitPython, available in 15 different languages, is the one of the easiest ways to program microcontrollers. We began with the Circuit Playground Express approximately three years ago, and reached 100 boards in January 2020 with the Open Hardware Summit badge. Now, over a year later, we've reached 200 boards. Chips supported include: Espressif, Microchip SAMDs, Nordic, NXP, RP2040s, ST, and more! Thank you to everyone in our community who has submitted boards to CircuitPython!

Check out the full list on [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)!

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No mnore digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210420/20210420pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210420/20210420pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210420/20210420pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm working on dynamic USB descriptors, which you allow you to enable or disable CircuitPython's USB mass storage, the REPL serial connection, another data-only serial connection, MIDI, and also select among HID devices. All of this you can do in boot.py, to customize which devices are available. In addition, for HID, you'll be able to supply your own HID device descriptors, so you can make that custom gamepad or joystick or other device that isn't built-in to CircuitPython.

So far I have most of the Python API and documentation written. I've also modified the Python-based compile-time descriptor generator we already use to output additional information so the code can renumber interfaces and endpoints at run-time. I hope to have something for you to try relatively soon.

**Jeff**

Based on a user request, I added RGBMatrix (protomatter) support for the Feather M4 CAN in our main development branch.  This uses all the same code as SAM D51 microcontrollers, but because this board has a SAM E51 small modifications were needed to enable it.

The bulk of my time over the last week was spent trying to enable the I2S digital audio interface on the imxrt10xx, but something's preventing it from working and I've decided to set it aside for now.

**Kattni**

This week, I published the Neo Trinkey guide. It includes some fun examples using the capacitive touch pads and the built-in four NeoPixel LEDs. It also has everything you need to get started with your Neo Trinkey, including pinouts, CircuitPython basics, and resource downloads. If you snagged one of these cute little boards, and want a hand getting started with it, check out this guide.

This guide includes templates! I finally have a live example of what I've been working on. Here is an example of one of the templates: [NeoPixel Blink](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neo-trinkey/neopixel-blink). Most of the page is immutable in the editor, but there are spaces to include a tailored image and specific code. This page will be included in the guide for any board that has only built-in NeoPixel LEDs (and no little red LED). For example, a similar page would be included in the QT Py guide (and will be eventually!).

Next up is updating a couple of guides with the QT revision of the breakout, and then onto the FunHouse guide.

**Lucian**

This past week I've been finalizing some changes to the internal structure of the Alarm system, which fix some important bugs but also make it easier to maintain the sleep functions across all the different ports. I've drafted the revisions for the ESP32-S2, since it still has the issue with mismatched objects that I'd previously fixed for STM32. If accepted, it's still not going to make sleep completely uncomplicated - there's a lot of funny exception stuff that has to go on - but at least it should make it easier for new and existing contributors to follow the responsibilities of the internal functions.

[![Lucian](../assets/20210420/20210420lucian.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I've also been monitoring the existing power PRs to try and make sure they all stay up to date and can be merged in any order. Since the NRF, STM32, RP2040 and ESP32-S2 all have active Alarm-related development going on, it's a lot to manage - hopefully everything can start getting merged in this week so development can go back to being a bit more linear.

**Melissa**

This past week, I've been working on the FunHouse. First I wrote the FunHouse library, which is similar to the MagTag library, but with different peripherals and MQTT functionality. The library is available either in the [Adafruit CircuitPython Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases) or from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_FunHouse.

Once the library was complete, I wrote a guide on using the Funhouse board with home assistant. In the guide, I go over setting up the FunHouse project as well as how to do some more advanced things such as mapping the buttons to toggle lights and emulating an RGB bulb with the DotStars so it can be controlled from Home Assistant like any other light. Keep an eye out for the upcoming guide.

**Scott**

Last week I gave a short and sweet talk at the Open Hardware Summit about interface design. The video is up [here](https://youtu.be/3QewiyfBQh8). I also streamed [the one year anniversary of deep dives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7djiPZU85OY).

Code-wise I added a larger read/write to the BLE file transfer test. It found some bugs in the implementation but also allowed me to measure transfer speed. I'll continue this work the second half of this week. I'll also incorporate some changes based on feedback from [the protocol design PR](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE_File_Transfer/pull/1).

I spent the first half of this week improving our GitHub actions tooling. Specifically, I setup [a GitHub action](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-action-library-ci-failed) to post a helpful comment to CircuitPython library PRs that fail. I also added [an action](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-action-library-ci-problem-matchers) to better find and highlight the errors. pylint errors will now show on the related line in the files view.
