[![Python Developer's Survey](../assets/20211026/20211026psf.jpg)](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/10/join-python-developers-survey-2021.html)

Join the Python Developers Survey 2021 - this year the PSF conducting the fifth iteration of the official Python Developers Survey. The goal is to capture the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year's, they can identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community and the key insights into them - [Survey Link](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/c1-python-developers-survey-2021) and information via the [Python Software Foundation](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/10/join-python-developers-survey-2021.html).

Also - do you now someone who should be a Python Software Foundation Fellow but isn't yet? Nominate them before November 20, 2021, and PSF will add them to the list for considering Q4 2021 fellows - [Nomination instructions](https://python.org/psf/fellows/).

Adafruit is doing a little revision of the favorite [Feather M4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857) – with all the new things folks love from the last few years! From the RP2040 they’re borrowing the built-in STEMMA QT I2C port and 8MB QSPI flash. From the STM32 Feather, the bottom SD card slot. From the upcoming ESP32-S2 Feather, lower power usage by putting the I2C/SD/NeoPixel on disable-able power. Many still like the original Feather M4 but who doesn’t love a glow-up? Adafruit is gonna try this new PCB in pink. It also comes with USB-C.

> We are thinking of doing a RP2040 Adalogger as well, with an SD card, but only if a bunch of ya’ll want it, so make some noise if so - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/10/23/feather-m4-adalogger-is-pretty-in-pink/).

## Updated Guides

[![Adafruit Bluefruit LE Sniffer](../assets/20211026/20211026blue.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/10/22/updated-guide-introducing-the-adafruit-bluefruit-le-sniffer-adafruitlearningsystem-adafruit/)

The Introducing the [Adafruit Bluefruit LE Sniffer guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-adafruit-bluefruit-le-sniffer) was in much need of a refresh. The guide has been updated to show how to install and setup all the necessary software components. Luckily the Adafruit BLE Sniffer still works fine when using the latest versions of Wireshark, the Nordic plugin, and best of all – Python 3 - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/10/22/updated-guide-introducing-the-adafruit-bluefruit-le-sniffer-adafruitlearningsystem-adafruit/).

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20211026/20211026bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20211026/20211026pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20211026/20211026pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20211026/20211026pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20211026/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I fixed a PDMIn microphone bug on SAMD21, which was quite tricky to figure out. Thanks to Scott for talking through the possible causes.

A major focus of CircuitPython 8.0.0 will be support for cooperative multitasking, which is provided in regular Python by asyncio and similar packages. A subset of asyncio has already been implemented in MicroPython, and we might use that, or develop something similar.  A simple example is to blink two LEDs at different rates as independent tasks. Another example would be to interrupt and change a running NeoPixel animation with a button push, without having to check explicitly inside the animation code for the interrupt. Or, you might want to do other work while waiting for, an I2C device to respond or a network request to finish. I'll be spending time looking at this in more detail as we head toward 8.0.0.

Last week I implemented the `watchdog` module for SAM D5x/E5x microcontrollers (it was already available on most of the other families). This allows the microcontroller to reset itself if something goes wrong in a CircuitPython program that stops it from executing

I have a clock that this happens to, but more no more often than once a month, so it's a tough problem to debug. If you have a project where "automatically resetting" is better than "getting lost & stuck", consider enabling a `watchdog` to automatically reset it when things go wrong.

This week I published the [ATtiny817 Breakout guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-attiny817-seesaw). This turned out to be a beefy one, with all the details about the [ATtiny817 breakout with seesaw and STEMMA QT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5233). It has everything you need to know about seesaw in general, and specific details and examples in both CircuitPython and Arduino for the ATtiny817 breakout with seesaw. If you picked up one of these versatile little boards, and need help getting started, check out this guide!

I'm now updating the [Welcome to CircuitPython guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/overview). This guide has been around for quite a while now, and has gone through many additions over that time. Which has been excellent, but has also caused it to grow and left it a bit meandering. To that end, I'm working on updating and restructuring the guide to provide the best possible experience to those getting started with CircuitPython.

**Melissa**

This past week I finished up the file opening and saving dialogs and fixed any bugs that I came across. One particularly weird bug I came across was that it was writing random garbage to the files when saving them. I figured out it was only saving from a certain offset where the file was edited and anything before the offset was just whatever CircuitPython had in its memory. By changing it to write from the beginning of the file, it fixed the issue. The Code Editor is available at https://code.circuitpython.org/.

**Scott**

This week I hit a road block with TinyUSB on the Raspberry Pi so I switched to getting CircuitPython going over UART. I've made really good progress! I got the REPL working over UART and LEDs blinking. My next goal was to get displayio working over HDMI. That is the main reason I'm interested in getting CircuitPython going on the RPi. I spent all day yesterday poking at it only to realize I hadn't fully seated my compute module on the IO board! Such a simple mistake. Once I did that, I was able to advance the code past where I was stuck. So I'm unblocked.

Furthermore, it turns out that the USB pins are also on the same connector! So, I need to circle back to that and see how much is working. It'd be great to get both HDMI and USB working soon.
