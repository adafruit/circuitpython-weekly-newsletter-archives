## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added but several are in sdevelopment.

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20211005/20211005bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20211005/20211005pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20211005/20211005pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20211005/20211005pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20211005/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

I finished a partial emulation of the radial controller of the Microsoft Surface Dial and am writing it up as part of a guide about custom HID devices that describes other devices as well. It took a lot of trial and error to determine the details of the HID report descriptor, and ranges of values that work best. I still some unanswered questions, but it's quite workable now.

I finally dipped my toes into Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with CircuitPython. You can check out [my new guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/ble-thermal-cat-printer-with-circuitpython/overview), which shows how to print bitmap images to a "cute cat" thermal printer.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Proximity Trinkey guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-proximity-trinkey). It has everything you need to get started with your Proximity Trinkey, including an overview, pinouts, download resources, and examples in both CircuitPython and Arduino. After that, I began working on the [ANO rotary encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5001) guide. If you picked up one of these fun encoders, or the [breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5221), keep an eye out for this guide!

**Melissa**

This past week, I worked on creating a rotary encoder controlled Animated Gif Player. I actually created two different versions of the code. I started with the some Animated Gif Player code I had created to run in Python about a year and a half ago. I optimized the code a bit and updated it to work with the new I2C rotary encoder. The other version I did took it further and added support for PyGame so it could be played on the desktop of a raspberry pi. You can check out the Learn guide [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/python-rotary-animated-gif-player-two-different-ways).

**Scott**

Last week I was working on getting the Memory Management Unit (MMU) of the BCM2711 to cooperate with me. I succeeded on [my Deep Dive stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv1HEFcL4Hw) last week.

I've now got a decent grasp on the new to me architecture and want to take a bit of time to prep a baseline library for doing the basic low level stuff. It's the [broadcom-peripherals](https://github.com/adafruit/broadcom-peripherals) library and will be useful in TinyUSB, CircuitPython and other bare metal Raspberry Pi projects. It mimics the ARM CMSIS files available for Cortex-M microcontrollers that we've previously used.
