## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released the first release candidate for CircuitPython 6.2.0 early in the morning of April 1. Perhaps by the time you read this, 6.2.0 stable will be out.

Previously, some I2C devices were not working on the RP2040. There were multiple causes for this, and finally a joint effort of several of us inside and outside of Adafruit solved the problem completely. The pico-sdk code was not respecting a certain time interval defined in the I2C specification. Most devices tolerated a shorter interval, but a few did not. This has been fixed in CircuitPython and is being fixed in the upstream pico-sdk repo as well.

For CircuitPython 7.0.0, I'll be working on dynamic USB descriptors, so that you don't have to build a custom version of CircuitPython to add or remove a USB or USB HID device.I hope to be able this support both general-purpose and still make it small enough to fit onto our smallest boards, which are often used to build HID-based gadgets.


**Jeff**

My work continues to be on the RT1011 board. We've ironed out the problems we're aware of with SPI, and even enabled the micro SD card on the Teensy 4.1 to work (albeit with the slow `bitbangio` version of SPI). Currently, I'm working on PWM, which has only been incompletely implemented so far.

**Kattni**

First solo newsletter was deployed successfully! I hope you enjoyed it. 

This week, I have been primarily working on templating the CircuitPython Essentials guide. As previously explained, the goal is to recreate the guide as templates that can be tailored to each board, and then include them in every Adafruit CircuitPython-compatible board guide. This will make the experience for folks who are new to CircuitPython much smoother, as, instead of a general page explaining a concept, each page included in the guide will be specific to the board.

Other than that, I went through my todo list and finished up a number of things that had been forgotten along the way. At the moment, I'm caught up on that front.

**Lucian**

This past week, I've been working on the last bugs of the STM32 and NRF low power implementations, tracking down why specific hard crashes occur when retrieving alarms after sleep. I've also been transitioning into the RP2040, setting up the basics for the deep sleep implementation on that platform. And having now worked through low power once, there are some elements of the program flow I'd hoping to change across all ports, things like comment cleanup and renaming to help with future maintainability.

**Melissa**

This week I got the Dynamic Bundler completely working. I got past the CORS issue I was having by automatically uploading all of the release assets to Amazon S3 and adding a CORS header. You can take a look at the Dynamic Bundler by visiting [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Dynamic_Bundler). There you'll find usage instructions and the URL to access it.

The other major project that I worked on this week was setting up my Development Environment and learning TypeScript enough to fix an issue with the Visual Studio Code extension for CircuitPython. A library that was added a month ago broke the extension because it was structured a bit different than the extension was expecting and I updated the code to deal with the new structure better. you can check out the extension in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joedevivo.vscode-circuitpython).

**Scott**

This week I've switched the RP2040 and the generic external flash controller in CircuitPython to using nvm.toml. As a result, the flash chip-specific configuration is now shared. The last remaining thing is to switch the iMX RT (think Teensy 4.x) to the flash configuration. It's lower on my list so it'll come at a later date.

My higher priority now is getting the individual BLE workflow components sketched out. Getting the initial workflow components going will allow us to start exploring and experimenting the phone app side. We'll have initial CircuitPython implementations up soon that folks can experiment with and will make it easy to evolve the protocols.
