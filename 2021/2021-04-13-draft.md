Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## The Adafruit Learn System Project Bundle

New in the Adafruit Learn System: Project Bundles! Gone are the days of digging through the Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle to find the libraries you need. You can now easily download the code, libraries, and any images, sounds and so on, in one zip file. 

Ladyada discusses it on last weekend's [Desk of Ladyada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDlh4BuvJ-g) live stream!

[![Ladyada downloading a project bundle](../assets/20210413/20210413ladyada.png)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

**To use the Project Bundle:**

Above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you'll find a Project Zip link.

[![Project bundle link](../assets/20210413/20210413pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the link to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project bundle zip and folder](../assets/20210413/20210413pbzip.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project bundle contents](../assets/20210413/20210413pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you're ready to go!

Check it out in a guide in the [Adafruit Learn System](https://learn.adafruit.com/)!

This feature is still new, so there may be changes to how it works in the near future. For example, we intend to make the link more obvious.

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please [file an issue](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues) on the Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I made the final, stable, release of 6.2.0 on Monday, April 7. There was only one bug we felt we needed to fix between rc.0 and stable, so we didn't bother with a second release candidate. Thanks to all the people who help to make 6.2.0: we had many new contributors, and an incredible number of fixes and additions through the betas.

Late last week I had an idea about having an interrupt throw an exception. It turned out to be a bad idea in general, but it provoked a lot of good discussion on discord and GitHub about how to handle interrupts in safe and simple ways. Please contribute to our GitHub issue [Interrupts: what are your use cases?](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/4542) with your uses for interrupts.

I'm now working on dynamic USB descriptors as I mentioned last week. It's just in time: I'm seeing at least two queries a day about whether it's possible to enable or disable various USB devices.

**Jeff**

With the stable release of version 6.2, it's a good time to look back at what we've done since 6.1.  Here are some of the highlights from my own work:

 * I helped us to adopt a source code formatter, "uncrustify", so the source is tidier and more consistent.  The value of consistent source style can't be overestimated, though it's not always apparent until you work on code that others have written
 * I did a nice range of clean-ups and bug-fixes, such as one that lets ulab directly manipulate the contents of an RGB Matrix display (I still need to do a demo that takes advantage of this)
 * I started to add more ways to get data between ulab arrays and displayio Bitmaps
 * I improved the RP2040 ("Pico") builds with new features & bugfixes in many areas such as urandom, rtc, and rp2pio.

There's a lot of good stuff in 6.2.0, and it's amazing to think it's just our progress since January.  For you, it's a great time to check it out and let us know how updating you own projects goes.  For me, it's time to knuckle down and get started on what will become CircuitPython version 7!

**Kattni**

Another successful newsletter went out this week! Thank you to everyone who has been contributing.

I've started working on the guide for the new [Neo Trinkey](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4870). It'll have everything you need to get started with your new board. Keep an eye out for that coming soon.

I've also continued work on the template quest. Specifically, I've been working on the pages applicable to the Neo Trinkey since that guide is going up soon. As this board is pretty simple, it'll only include information on NeoPixels and capacitive touch, so those are the pages I've been focusing on. Working on getting some templates live soon so I can share them!

**Lucian**

This past week I've been getting started with alarms and sleep on the RP2040, digging into the documentation and doing some basic tests and implementation. The RP is a little different from other chips in that it doesn't lose any data when it goes into deep sleep - this is a handy feature for conventional C programs, but it doesn't jive that well with Circuitpython's API, which expects a full reset after a deep sleep. So I'm spending a little extra time making sure that this won't break everything horribly when implemented.

Outside my RP spinup I wrapped up some final deep-sleep related issues for the STM32 and put through the first finished draft of the power PR, along with an unrelated issue across all ports where light sleep was misreporting its wakeup cause depending on how you tried to fetch that information.

We had a community contributor add the AudioPWMIO module to the STM32 port this past week, which I had the chance to review and test. It's a nice feature, and I'm hoping we'll see more audio implementations come in over time, as they'll benefit a lot from the extra resources on the F405 Feather.

**Melissa**

This week I wrote the new FunHouse library. Like several other libraries, this one is based on PortalBase which is the shared library that acts as a base library for Portal style devices. I added a couple of examples to the library as well so folks can start using it right away. I always find it fun to experiment and make design decisions so that it is both easy to use and maintainable. If you would like to check out the new library, you can find it in [the GitHub FunHouse Repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_FunHouse).

I also updated circuitpython.org with a number of missing boards. I found there was a particular library that was confusing the backend and instead of the missing boards appearing as "Unknown", they didn't show up at all and so nobody was aware that it was an issue until enough missing ones accumulated that people were questioning why certain boards weren't there.

**Scott**

This week I've completed my initial BLE file transfer protocol implementation. I've written up the protocol and created [a pull request](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE_File_Transfer/pull/1) to get feedback on it. Trevor has gotten it going and will be trying to integrate it into the iOS side of things. In addition to replying to feedback, I'll be fixing the example to work with larger file transfers.

I'm also prepping to present at the Open Hardware Summit about interface design. I'll be giving a quick and (hopefully) concise talk with tips about designing interfaces. Interfaces encompass mechanical, electrical and software design.
