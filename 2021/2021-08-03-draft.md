## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added.

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210803/20210803bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210803/20210803pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210803/20210803pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210803/20210803pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210803/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **329**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

CircuitPython 7 is dropping `gamepad` in favor of `keypad`. Kattni, FoamyGuy, and I worked on a transition strategy, because there is not room in the smallest builds to have both. We were able to drop some little-used functionality in a couple of libraries, and change others to work on both CircuitPython 6 and 7.

I have been working on and off on audio-playing problems on the RP2040, which also show up in different ways on some other ports. I believe I have finally started to make progress on this set of issues, after creating a systematic set of tests.

I am also working on some `usb_hid` API changes for CircuitPython 7. When these are done, the API changes we have planned for 7 will be done, and we can start doing beta releases.

Another camera week!  I'm working on a demo to take upload the JPEG image from an OV2640 camera to Adafruit IO.

In the core, I added a section at the top of each built-in module listing the boards that include the module, instead of requiring a visit to a separate page to check.

This week I published the [NeoKey Ortho Snap-Apart guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neokey-5x6-ortho-snap-apart). This guide has everything you need to get started working with your NeoKey Snap key matrix including overview, pinouts details and download resources. It also has examples for both Arduino and CircuitPython, including detailed wiring diagrams. 

I also updated the [MacroPad RP2040 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-macropad-rp2040/macropad-circuitpython-library) to have documentation about the Adafruit CircuitPython MacroPad library including basics, display text, display image, rotation, playing a tone, keyboard and mouse, and MIDI examples. The MacroPad library makes working with the MacroPad super simple, and the guide now has everything you need to know about using the library. Check it out!

This past week, I wrapped up the WebSerial ESPTool improvements I made, but was unable to get the stub code for the ESP32 functioning at the faster speeds, which is what I originally wanted to do. After that I ported the keypad module from CircuitPython to Blinka and ended up doing a full implementation. It has been merged in and is ready for use. Usage information with the NeoKey Ortho and Snap Apart keys should be coming soon, but the [example code for CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neokey-5x6-ortho-snap-apart/circuitpython) just needs the pins changed to the appropriate Raspberry Pi pins and it should just work.

This week I've continued squashing bugs for 7.0.0. Here it is:
* Fix CTRL-C on ESP when fake deep sleeping.
* Fixed a crash on ESP32-S2 when true deep sleeping.
* Fix nRF time alarms after the first fake deep sleep.
* Switched all ports to the new PulseOut(pin, frequency, duty_cycle) API.
* Fixed pin in use tracking on STM32 for PulseOut.
* Fixed RP2040 PulseOut
* Fixed Arduino RP2040 flash size. (Back up your files and then erase it if you've already got it setup.)
* Added support for multiple status RGB LEDs. Playground boards will now blink all of the neopixels.
* Got rid of all OSError(0)'s on ESP32-S2 and removed the older network modules.

Next I'm going to take a crack at the nRF bug that hung me up a week ago or so. It'll bring me back into nRF land.
