## The HP Prime G2 Calculator Supports Two Types of Python

[![HP Prime G2 Calculator](../assets/20210706/20210706calc.jpg)](https://twitter.com/hangyodon1123/status/1410552863630131209)

[![HP Prime G2 Calculator](../assets/20210706/20210706calc2.jpg)](https://twitter.com/hangyodon1123/status/1410552863630131209)

Twitter user [@hangyodon1123](https://twitter.com/hangyodon1123) notes on the HP Prime G2 calculator (apparently a Japanese version) supports two flavors of Python. The first is t_cas01 which features Python syntax with CAS (computer algebra system) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hangyodon1123/status/1410552863630131209).

Hardware specifications on the HP Prime G2 - [cemetech.net](https://www.cemetech.net/tools/prime).

From beta release notes, April 2021 - [hpcalc.org](https://www.hpcalc.org/prime/beta/betanotes.zip) (zip):

> Prime now includes a Python interpreter. This interprets Python scripts using the MicroPython interpreter. However, due to the way MicroPython manages memory, the Python interpreter is started with a fixed heap and stack of repectively 1MB and 40KB. Replacing the first parameter of the Python call to a list containing 2 or 3 items allows to change this.

Some additional documentation on Python for the Prime G2 is on a French site - [tiplanet.org](https://tiplanet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=55&t=24837&view=unread#HPPPY1).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added, but several are in development.

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210706/20210706bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210706/20210706pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210706/20210706pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210706/20210706pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210706/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I wrote a [Learn Guide for the new `keypad` module](https://learn.adafruit.com/key-pad-matrix-scanning-in-circuitpython).

I'll be making the CircuitPython 7.0.0-alpha.4 release shortly. It should be out by the time you read this.

I'm back to looking at RP2040 audio problems, which are fairly mysterious at first glance. Both I2S and PWM audio are affected, in different ways.

It's felt like a long path, but last week the guide for [Capturing Camera Images with CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/capturing-camera-images-with-circuitpython) went live on the Learn system. This follows several weeks of both implementing the ParallelImageCapture class in the CircuitPython core as well as libraries for configuring the OV7670 and OV2640 cameras. 

Like most of the fun stuff we've been talking about lately this is going to be available in CircuitPython 7! But you can grab the latest builds and try it out today.

This week I published the MacroPad RP2040 guide. It has plenty to get you started with your new MacroPad including pPinouts, CircuitPython and Arduino examples, and downloads resources. If you managed to snag a MacroPad, and you're wondering where to begin, this guide is for you.

I also started work on a MacroPad CircuitPython library that will make using the MacroPad even simpler. Keep an eye out for that!

This past week, I worked on an NVS Partition Generator that will allow us to take user supplied data and generate a partition for the ESP32 so that WipperSnapper will be able to work on the ESP32 chips, which don't have native USB.

Once I got that working, I realized there were some issues with the WebSerial ESPTool with the ESP32 and will be working on some stability improvements.

BLE file transfer code has been merged in. Now the challenge is to provide ways to use it. I've gotten sucked into using web bluetooth to communicate with a CP device from Chrome. I'm making pretty good progress and hope to provide a FileTransferClient Javascript library that folks can use. I also hope to use this in a web editor for CircuitPython that is somewhere on circuitpython.org.

I've also got pending BLE serial code that is nearly ready for pull request review. I'll polish it up soon and get it merged in.

Lots of good progress! Stay tuned via Show and Tell and my own Deep Dive streams.
