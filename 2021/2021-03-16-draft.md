[![Piper Make](../assets/20210316/20210316piper3.jpg)](https://make.playpiper.com/)

Piper Learning released a new product, Piper Make, which is a browser-based coding platform for the Raspberry Pi Pico. It has a block-programming interface based on Google Blockly. The underlying code is CircuitPython! 

You can sccess the interface, which is similar to MakeCode, at [https://make.playpiper.com/](https://make.playpiper.com/).

Under the hood, there is a CircuitPython helper library Piper has created - [GitHub](https://github.com/buildwithpiper/PiperBlocklyLibrary).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210316/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

After systematically commenting out code and then re-enabling it bit by bit, I was able to figure out an apparent solution to the problematic interaction between wifi and I2C on the ESP32-S2. It's still not clear to me exactly why this solution works, and I'm awaiting some feedback from the ESP32-S2 developers, but testing seems to confirm the fix.

We got some good feedback on the default addition of the second USB serial channel in CircuitPython. It does cause some confusion because now there are two serial devices, and in some cases it's not obvious which one is the REPL. Because of this, we are going to turn the feature off by default for 6.2.0 but still make it available for custom builds. In 7.0.0 we will make it possible to enable and disable it in `boot.py`, and then advertise it more widely. The problem of detecting which serial port is which still exists, and I am working on a small Python library which will run on host computers and allow the ports to be distinguished.

I have been doing various things in this port, such as enabling MP3 playback (only works for very low bitrate MP3s, try mono and 32kbit/s; you can it up to about 20 minutes of audio on the Feather's built-in flash at this compression ratio though!), fixing problems with how CircuitPython initialized the built in real-time clock, and documented how to install the debugging header on the Adafruit Feather RP2040 on the Learn system.

This week I updated [the AMG8833 thermal camera guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-amg8833-8x8-thermal-camera-sensor) for the STEMMA QT revision of the board. The guide now includes updated images, pinouts and wiring diagrams. You can pick one up in the [Adafruit shop](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3538) and check out the guide to get started.

I also published the [Feather RP2040 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-rp2040-pico), which includes everything you need to get started using your new [Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4884). The Pinouts page is especially detailed to keep up with the pins on the RP2040 having so many different functions. They are listed by pin name, with details about each pin, and by function (e.g. I2C, SPI, etc), so you can easily figure out what you're looking for by pin name or by function.

We continued the Pylint update by finishing up the PRs on the libraries skipped by the initial patch. We found that Pylint was failing significantly on libraries with `tests` directories. So, we set up a separate pre-commit hook to handle running Pylint on test files, similar to how we run it on example code. There's still a bit left to do on this project, but we're nearing the end.

Finally, thanks to Dylan for updating our Adabot script to only report a library as needing a release when the code, documentation, or packaging changes. This will reduce unnecessary work for everyone when using the Adabot check to keep up with releases, as changes to the CI (continuous integration) do not require a release.

This past week I've been digging into low power performance on the STM32, extracting the RTC module out from the port functions so that it can be used to wake from low power modes. Since entering the lowest possible power state of "Standby" for deep sleep disrupts both USB and external debuggers like the JLink, I've been using a logic analyzer to visualize the timing of the interrupts as they occur, so I can better debug problems with staying in deep sleep mode. 

I've also been considering requests for altering the clock settings of Circuitpython on boot, so that projects can use overclocking or underclocking to do things like boosting performance or lowering electrical noise. This has some complications about how it would affect peripherals across different ports, but could be a powerful feature.

This past week I started with looking into a guide I had written for running Google Assistant as we were getting reports of it not running. It turns out that I didn't specify that users should be running the lite version and the ones having issues were running the desktop version. I updated the guide with this information.

I worked on some memory issues that users were experiencing with the MatrixPortal due to some libraries getting new features and some areas that could have used some optimization. After updating it, I had some scripts that were crashing run in a much more stable manner.

I worked on updating the RPLIDAR driver to work with some of the newer units shipping with updated firmware. Unfortunately, this was proving to be extra challenging because they Slamtec did not provide the newer firmware on their website for updating older units. So it relied on following available documentation, making sure it didn't break the older firmware, and having users with newer firmware test it for me.

I also started working on a guide for the 2.13" eInk displays. This included writing a new driver for the SSD1680 chip which the updated feather from last year also uses. Be sure to watch new guides and keep an eye out for it.

This week I've been focused on improving flash chip support in CircuitPython for the RP2040 specifically. I've rewritten the flash init code from assembly into C to make it easier to maintain. I also hacked a Feather RP2040 to use a [SOIC socket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4726) to allow me to swap different flash chips without needing to solder them down. I also soldered in wires so I can capture the SPI traffic to analyze it. This is *very very* helpful when debugging flash init code and other bugs.

My hope is to get a PR out by this time next week to optimize for different flash chips with the RP2040.
