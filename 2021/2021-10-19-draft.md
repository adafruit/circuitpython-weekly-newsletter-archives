If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## Events Planning

[![RISC-V Summit](../assets/20211019/20211019riscv.jpg)](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/riscv-summit/register/)

RISC-V Summit brings the community together to show the power open collaboration can have on the processor industry. The audience spans across industries, organizations, workloads, and geographies to learn about the technology advancements in the RISC-V ecosystem and visibility of RISC-V successes. The event is December 6 – 8, in-person in San Francisco or virtually from anywhere in the world - [Linux Foundation](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/riscv-summit/register/) via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/risc_v/status/1449886188941238274).

[![PyCon US 2022](../assets/20211019/pyconus2022.png)](https://us.pycon.org/2022/l)

PyCon US 2022 planning is underway. The team is planning to host the event in person with an online component. April 27, 2022 - May 5, 2022. Head over to the [PyCon US 2022 website](https://us.pycon.org/2022/) for details about the conference and more information about the sponsorship program - [PyCon Blog](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2021/10/pycon-us-2022-website-and-sponsorship.html).

## An Ultra-thin, Portable Keyboard Running CircuitPython on a RP2040

[![Keyboard](../assets/20211019/20211019key.jpg)](https://www.reddit.com/r/circuitpython/comments/q88gav/my_thinnest_most_portable_keyboard_runs/)

Based on the PyKey60, this ultra-portable keyboard is inspired from Keyboardio's Atreus but uses low profile Kailh Choc switches instead. These are lower profile than standard MX switches and even have a slightly closer pitch from switch to switch; making the keys closer to each other.

> Why did I create a custom board instead of using a Raspberry Pi Pico? The Pico wouldn't allow for the thinnest keyboard. Its position would need room below the PCB and thus would also need a bottom plate to enclose it all, defeating the whole point of an ultra-low profile keyboard.

The project uses 44 Kailh Choc Low Profile Hot Swappable key switches, a RP2040 controller, and USB-C. It runs CircuitPython, changing the keymap is as easy as changing a file on the keyboard - [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/circuitpython/comments/q88gav/my_thinnest_most_portable_keyboard_runs/).

## A New Boot Sequence Chart for CircuitPython 7

[![New Boot Sequence Chart for CircuitPython 7](../assets/20211019/20211019chart.jpg)](https://twitter.com/anne_engineer/status/1449071743520358408)

A new chart diagraming the boot sequence for CircuitPython 7 has been published. Importantly, the colors of onboard colored LEDs has changed somewhat in the new version to aid in debugging. The chart will be incorporated into existing CircuitPython documentation soon - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anne_engineer/status/1449071743520358408).

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20211019/20211019bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20211019/20211019pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20211019/20211019pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20211019/20211019pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20211019/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I have gotten boot keyboard support to work in CircuitPython. It's necessary to turn off most or all of the other USB devices to ensure that HID is the first device interface listed. That matches the expectations of the BIOS and similar software. After some more testing on a Mac, I'll turn this into a PR.

My attempts at simplifying the Windows 7/8.1 drivers failed. Ideally, I'd like anything identifying as a CDC serial device to use the USB serial driver. That is what is built in to Windows 10. But as a third-party driver provider in Windows 7/8.1, I am not permitted to provide a "class driver", that is, a driver that matches all devices of a particular class. So instead I will automate the current manual process of adding boards to the Windows drivers.

I've continued working on support for the OV5640 camera. After a few enhancements, refresh rate of the camera preview to the Kaluga's LCD display is over 15FPS, up from less than 2 a week ago.

This week saw the publishing of the [Adafruit EyeLights LED Glasses and Driver guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-eyelights-led-glasses-and-driver), which was a collaboration between me and our very own Dragon, Phil B. This guide has everything you need to get started with your EyeLights Driver and LED Glasses panel including detailed pinouts, CircuitPython and Arduino setup instructions for the driver, and a bunch of starter projects for the LED glasses. When you get your new LED Glasses and Driver, check out this guide!

Next up is the guide for the [ATtiny8x7 breakout with seesaw and STEMMA QT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5233). This guide will have a number of examples for seesaw in both CircuitPython and Arduino, as well as look at the seesaw API. If you picked up one of these nifty little boards, keep an eye out for this guide!

This past week I have been making use of the new functionality I added to the JavaScript BLE File Transfer library. Since the files are communicated through Web Bluetooth, I was not able to make use of any standard file UI elements and needed to create a new one from scratch. I took inspiration from some existing ones, but also opted for a simpler interface so it would be faster to develop. Right now I'm only working on the basic functionality of choosing files and may go back later and add functions such as creating, deleting, and renaming files and folders to make file management possible without a computer.

At this point I have basic file navigation working nicely. I have the file dialog displaying as a modal and I'm making use of font awesome for the icons and showing different icons based on file type. You can also navigate into subfolders and back up.

This week has been more plugging away at TinyUSB on the Raspberry Pi. I made good progress getting interrupts to work but then hit a wall getting USB itself going. I haven't been able to find clear examples of using the USB peripheral in device mode which has made it difficult to determine what I need to change. So, if you know anything about the broadcom chips and the DWC USB core please reach out to me.

In the meantime I've switched gears to getting CircuitPython going over UART. Hopefully it'll be in a good state once USB gets going and it'll be fast to put the two together.
