## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20211116/20211116bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20211116/20211116pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20211116/20211116pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20211116/20211116pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20211116/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **340**!

**Updated Libraries!**

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Experimental asyncio support will be in the next CircuitPython beta. I tweaked the MicroPython version of asyncio to work with CircuitPython, and it's now a [library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_asyncio). Along with this the latest builds of CircuitPython have also been adjusted to work with that library. Next, I'll be working on a Learn Guide with a number of examples.

**Jeff**

It was an exciting week for me, as a number of half-finished projects were merged into the CircuitPython core. The most recent additions are `dither` and `alphablend` in the bitmaptools library.  You can check out a short video about the functionality [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_NhAFZBHhI).

**Kattni**

This past week, I finished up the overhaul of the Welcome to CircuitPython guide. Please check it out! It's updated and better designed to provide a smooth experience for newcomers, while still offering up advanced knowledge to those who are looking for it. There are a couple of new pages as well, so take a look at those whether you're new to the guide or quite familiar with it.

I merged a number of PRs to get many more libraries in line with the latest Pylint, and helped out by submitting a few myself. As of this writing there are still ~40 to go, but based on the speed with which that's being addressed, I imagine everything will be done by the time this newsletter is published!

Next up is starting the guide for the Adafruit Monochrome 1.12" 128x128 OLED Graphic Display, a new OLED in the shop. Once complete, it'll have everything you need to get started with your new display. Keep an eye out for it.

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20211116/20211116melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week, I was out sick for a few days, but I did manage to get the new Raspberry Pi OS working with the PiTFT in desktop mode. It ended up being one of those problems that could have had many possible causes, but the final solution was pretty simple.

**Scott**

This week I've been doing two things in parallel. First, I've gotten CircuitPython running on the Pi Zero 2W. Second, I've been working hard to add SD card support to CircuitPython on the Raspberry Pi. Adding SD card support will allow the CIRCUITPY drive to appear as it does when running on microcontrollers. Once SD card support is going (it's *very* close) then I'll polish things up and get them merged into main CircuitPython and released.
