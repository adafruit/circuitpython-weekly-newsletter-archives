## Python snakes its way to the new Raspberry Pi Pico board and RP2040 chip

[![Pico](../assets/20210126/20210126picorp2040.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/01/21/raspberry-pi-pico-rp2040-and-adafruit-family-of-boards/)

[![RP2040 Chip](../assets/20210126/20210126rp2040.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/01/21/raspberry-pi-pico-rp2040-and-adafruit-family-of-boards/)

On January 21st, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched their first microcontroller-class product: the Raspberry Pi Pico. Priced at just $4, it is built on RP2040, a brand-new microcontroller chip developed by Raspberry Pi. That's not a typo. Unlike the Raspberry Pi boards to date, all have been single board computers (SBC) running Linux. The RP2040 and Pico board run code is developed by the user and run on the chip with no operating system.

Besides the Pico board (yes many other boards in the market are also named Pico...), several other manufacturers have announced boards based on the RP2040 chip, which will be on sale by itself in the second quarter of this year. Of course Adafruit has announced several new boards (see below).

The board launched with support for programming in C, MicroPython, and CircuitPython (see below). Arduino has stated they will support the RP2040 soon.

## V-R3x: CubeSat mission just launched to space with CircuitPython!

[![CubeSats](../assets/20210126/20210126cube.jpg)](https://twitter.com/NASAAmes/status/1352314971519008768)

[![Transporter-1](../assets/20210126/20210126t1patch.jpg)](https://www.spacex.com/launches/)

The V-R3x mission uses a swarm of three small satellites to demonstrate new technologies and techniques for radio networking and navigation. By developing and demonstrating these technologies on a small scale, they can be implemented for future multi-spacecraft missions. Using three satellites known as CubeSats, each about the size of a coffee mug, the mission will conduct a series of such demonstrations. They launched this past Sunday aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as a part of the Transporter-1 mission which launched 140 additional satellites, the most satelllites launched aboard one spacecraft. The V-R3x CubeSats contain PyCubed boards programmed in CircuitPython.

## Whatâ€™s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in!

**Dan**

Late last week, I made the 6.1.0-rc.1 release, and just today, as of this writing, I published the 6.1.0 stable release.  For some new boards, most notably the MagTag, there hasn't been a stable release yet, and in addition, the 6.1.0 development releases have been recommended over 6.0.x for ESP32-S2 for some time.

6.1.0 has some remaining known issues, but they are mostly bugs that existed in 6.0.1 as well. I spent a while studying a file writing delay that is due to not running USB tasks often enough, but could not determine the root cause immediately. So I will continue to work on it and not hold up the 6.1.0 release.

Last week Scott invited me to join him on his [weekly Deep Dive video stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0s_LK0K1Sk). We talked about the CircuitPython 2021 submissions, and then I discussed some bugs I'd recently worked on in detail. I enjoyed it very much, and am looking forward to seeing other CircuitPython contributors on the stream.

Continuing with the audio theme on ESP32-S2, I've begun implementing DAC-based AudioOut for this port. While there is not an API provided for this purpose in the ESP-IDF, there is a way to access the functionality at the machine register level, as well as a demo/test provided by Espressif.  I'm using this as a guide to implement our own code.  Hopefully, this will provide stereo, 8-bit audio outputs on this chip; enough to play Wave files on the MagTag's buzzer, for example.  However, this is at an early stage and hasn't actually made any noise yet.

**Kattni**

The last two weeks have been spent working on the [Getting Started guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico) for the new [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4864)! This guide covers getting started with the Pico and CircuitPython. You'll learn how to install CircuitPython on your board (spoiler alert: it's super simple!). Then you'll learn some CircuitPython programming basics - some of which are so useful that they have been slated for later addition to the Welcome to CircuitPython guide. Finally, the guide includes multiple project examples, from blinking an LED, to controlling the LED with a button, to building a traffic light simulator, reaction game and burglar alarm. The Overview contains a list of the hardware you need to complete all of the projects, so you can pick up all the extras and be ready to build! The guide and examples cover many of the features of the Pico board, and give you an excellent basis for expanding into your own projects. If you're getting a Pico, and you're looking to get started with CircuitPython, this guide is perfect for you. Check it out!

This past week, I worked on separating the TLS functions out of the Socket module. TLS stands for [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), and is a set of cryptographic protocols that help make internet communications secure - it's the successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) which is now deprecated.

Previously, Circuitpython's implementation of the Python [Sockets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) module (based on [Berkley Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets)) was using TLS functions directly for functions like connect, send, and receive_into. However, this didn't match the behavior of CPython, which includes only transport-layer protocols (TCP and UDP) in the default Socket module, and uses a different wrapper class called SSLSocket for all the cryptographic capability. I've now moved our TLS code into a new SSLSockets module for Circuitpython to match, and implemented TCP-only versions of functions like connect() for default sockets.

Since that's wrapped up and is waiting on my other Socket work to be accepted, I'm now learning about the guts of the low power code, so I can start helping out on the various bugs in that domain. Low power has been something I've been hoping for for a while, so I'm excited to get into it.

I also wrote my [Circuitpython 2021](http://howtobuildathing.com/2021/01/18/hierophects-circuitpython-2021/) post, and read the ones from everyone else. Good stuff!

This past week, I finished up the last of the PortalBase refactors by refactoring Blinka PyPortal. This was certainly simpler than the other libraries, but had its own challenge with some changes that allowed it to run in PyGame. Fortunately it wasn't too difficult to figure out with a few additional changes to PortalBase.

I ended up adding 2 boards to Blinka this week. First up was the BeagleBone AI. I thought it would be easier than it was, but soon came to realize the BeableBone IO library did not yet support it. So I took an alternative approach and used libgpiod. That worked well enough for GPIO and I2C. I was unable to get SPI running, but left what I had done in place. Most of the challenges I came across involved sparse documentation or conflicting information.

The other board I added was the NanoPi NEO Air. I figured this board would be pretty straightforward because it was based on the AllWinner H3 chip and we already had several boards using that. It didn't disappoint and I was able to get it added and completely functioning and tested in record time in just a couple of hours.

**Scott**

This week I've been getting the ducks all lined up in a row for the Raspberry Pi Pico / RP2040 CircuitPython launch. I've been working on the port for just over a month. At launch we have:
* digitalio
* analogio.AnalogIn
* busio.I2C, busio.SPI
* neopixel_write
* pwmio.PWMOut

In addition, we have a `rp2pio` module for the unique programmable IO peripheral in the RP2040. It is already used internally for neopixel.

Furthermore, we have full build enabled so things like `displayio`, `touchio`, `ulab`, `usb_midi` and `usb_hid` also work.

While most of the core APIs are included, more will be added in the coming months as we see all of the cool things folks want to use it for.
