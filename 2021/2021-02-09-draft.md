## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I've been working on adding a second USB serial channel to CircuitPython, so that a board can communicate with a host computer without the REPL getting in the way (ctrl-C), etc. The second channel will simply send and receive raw bytes. I thought we would have to turn off another USB device to make room, but it turns out for many boards we have enough USB "endpoints" (communications channels).

A number of our Learn Guide programs use a function called map_range() that is similar to the Arduino map() function. It is defined in the simpleio library, which has a lot of other stuff in it. I created a smaller library called adafruit_simplemath that just defined map_range() and one other related function.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [SPI Flash SD Card guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-spi-flash-sd-card). This is a nifty little breakout that is essentially a surface-mount SD card hooked up using SPI, but to CircuitPython (and Arduino), it's simply an SD card. So you can use the current SD library and code with it. The guide has all the info you need to get started, including wiring diagrams and download resources. If you picked up one of these breakouts and want to know more, check out the guide.

I added a new page to the CircuitPython Essentials guide explaining [CircuitPython Pins and Modules](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-pins-and-modules). This is the first time I cover in a guide how import board works and how CircuitPython knows where to look for the hardware you have connected in your project. I also explain how to find what CircuitPython modules are available for your board. This seems like basic stuff, but while folks constantly use board and other built-in modules in all of their CircuitPython code, it may not be clear to many how it works. This new page aims to clarify.

Next up is a guide for the new [Adafruit SHT40](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4885), as well as a guide for a coming soon, the ISO1540. 

**Lucian**

This past week I rebuilt my suite of network testing python sketches, which helped in nailing a number of remaining bugs in the Socket implementation and the Requests library layer above it. I also got started on implementing an interrupt driven approach for the STM32 I2C module, so it works with chips that require a repeated start condition.

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on Home Assistant in a couple of different ways. First I set up a sensor node using CircuitPython on the Metro ESP32-S2 to read a temperature and humidity sensor and report the results to Home Assistant. You can check out the guide I wrote titled [Temperature and Humidity Sensing in Home Assistant with CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/temperature-and-humidity-sensing-in-home-assistant-with-circuitpython), though it can be adapted for many other sensors.

The other thing I did was learned a lot about add-ons and have been researching some ways to integrate an ESP32-S2 board more tightly with Home Assistant using ESPHome. I should have more details in a future update.

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on audio playback on the RP2040. We should be able to do both PWM and I2S playback of raw samples and wav files. I tried to get MP3 going but our existing implementation uses some instructions that are missing from the Cortex-M0+. This is a first pass, so we'll just leave it disabled for now.

I've refactored the code a bit since I first started so I can share most of the DMA setup and buffer conversion between PWM and I2S. It's compiling and running under the newest version of the pico-sdk but I haven't actually tested playback. That'll be my focus tomorrow. Hopefully we'll get it checked in and released in the next week.

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/20210209/codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
