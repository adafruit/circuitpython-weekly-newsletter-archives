Welcome to this week's Python on Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! Featured in this issue: two focus sections - one for USB HID (keyboard/mouse) projects and one for MIDI music projects. Python on Microcontrollers, with prebuilt libraries, makes creating projects with these capabilities so much easier and shorter than in the past with Arduino.

Network with your fellow Pythonistas! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

CircuitPython 6.2.0 Beta 2 was recently released. This is the third beta release of CircuitPython 6.2.0. This release contains fixes and improvements, most notably for RP2040 and ESP32-S2 based boards - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/02/10/circuitpython-6-2-0-beta-2-released/)

## Visual Studio Code comes to Raspberry Pi

[![Visual Studio Code comes to Raspberry Pi](../assets/20210216/20210216vsc.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/visual-studio-code-comes-to-raspberry-pi/)

Visual Studio Code officially comes to Raspberry Pi. As well as supporting Debian Linux on x64, there are now builds for ARM and ARM64 – both of which can run on Raspberry Pi OS (the ARM build on Raspberry Pi OS, the ARM64 on the beta of the 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS)  - [Raspberry Pi Blog](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/visual-studio-code-comes-to-raspberry-pi/)

## Focus: MIDI - Digital Music

With MIDI baked into CircuitPython, getting new boards like the Raspberry Pi Pico using this music standard is straightforward. Below are some projects using MIDI posted on the internet this week.

### A Drum Machine with a Raspberry Pi Pico

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 6.2.0-beta.2, which has dozens of fixes and improvements, including fixes for some serious issues.

I fixed the `adafruit_sdcard` library to work properly with the new native `adafruit_bus_device` module. I've also been investigating I2C problems on the RP2040. One was a red herring, and the other seems peculiar to a particular sensor.

I'm continuing to work on the second USB serial channel for CircuitPython. Scott and I discussed and settled on the outlines of the Python API. There will probably be a `usb_cdc` module, with a fixed instance of the serial object, but with the flexibility to add more later.

**Jeff**

After taking a week off to read a book & work on my own projects, I'm back! I'm learning about the RP2040's "PIO" peripheral and with the help of community members I resolved a problem affecting neopixels on the Raspberry Pi Pico and other RP2040 boards. I also made a change to the tools that build the various "bundles", which should help circup by providing the "requirements.txt" files directly within the bundle; circup uses "requirements.txt" to decide what other libraries are needed to go with the requested library.

**Kattni**

This week I finalised the [new page](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-pins-and-modules) in the CircuitPython Essentials guide, and got it mirrored into every CircuitPython-compatible microcontroller guide. It covers using `import board` and `dir(board)` to tell CircuitPython where to look for the hardware you connected to your project, and how to learn about what pins and board objects are available for your microcontroller. It also explains how to find the built-in modules available for your board.

I published the [SHT40 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-sht40-temperature-humidity-sensor) as well, which has everything you need to get started sensing temperature and humidity with this excellent sensor. I published the [ISO1540 guide] as well. I completed quite a bit of miscellaneous from my long to-do list. 

I'm currently working on the guide for the AW9523. It's nearly done, but needs some final touches. It should be live quite soon. I'm also adding at least one more example to the Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Pico and CircuitPython guide, which should also be available soon.

**Lucian**

This past week I fixed a number of internal errors in the Socket module, such as inconsistencies in internal types, connection failures for accepted sockets, and a multi-layered disconnection problem in the Requests library. I also resolved an issue with I2C not correctly sending a Repeated Start condition when requested. 

These issues required updates to my manual testing scripts, which have gradually accumulated over my time working on Circuitpython. Since many of these tests might be helpful to others doing reviews or trying to resolve their own issues, I'm working on a new manual tests directory to store and share them, along with associated documentation.

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on adding ESP32-S2 support to ESPHome. I had to get past a number of bugs. Unfortunately as I got closer to the end, I came to one that stopped me from progressing any further for the moment and that is WiFi refused to connect when I had I2C enabled. Even if I wasn't doing anything with it. I submitted a bug report to the package which I think is the culprit and I will be moving on to some other projects in the mean time.

This week I'm on the home stretch for audio playback with the RP2040. I got both single sample buffer and WaveFile playback with PWM audio, the [pull request](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/4167).

I've begun work hooking up I2S which should be straightforward (fingers crossed.) Since we'll use the PIO for I2S, I'm also adding a few more APIs to the StateMachine class.

Once I'm out the audio weeds I'll be circling back to internal flash config with a possible detour to implement UART if no one has beat me to it.

Last night I also hacked a system to allow me to [use my right hand on my keyboard for mouse clicks](https://twitter.com/tannewt/status/1359937799173021699). I'm very happy with it so far.
