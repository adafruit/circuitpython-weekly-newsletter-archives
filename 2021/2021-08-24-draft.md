## CircuitPython 7.0.0 Beta 0 Released

[![CircuitPython 7.0.0 Beta 0 Released](../assets/20210824/20210824cp7.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases)

CircuitPython 7.0.0-beta.0, has been released. Beta builds mark the final testing of CircuitPython 7 for stable release. It is relatively stable, but contains issues still to be addressed for 7.0.0. The Python API's it presents are not expected to change incompatibly before the final 7.0.0 release, though they may be augmented.

Notable additions to 7.0.0 since 6.3.0 include:

- Support for the CircuitPython development workflow over BLE.
- Camera support on ESP32S2.
- `qrio`: QR code decoding.
- The `keypad` key-scanning module.
- Run-time customization of USB devices.
- Merging in of MicroPython fixes and enhancements as of MicroPython 1.16.
- `\_pixelbuf` is now `adafruit_pixelbuf`.
- `colorwheel()` routine moved to `rainbowio`.
- `supervisor.ticks_ms()` to allow easier time-keeping.
-  Simplifications to the RGB status LED codes.
- A clocking fix for a few samples of RP2040 boards.
- Rework of `vectorio` and some of its API. `VectorShape` is no longer needed for user code.
- `atexit` module.
- `getpass` module.
- `traceback` module.
- `supervisor.get_previous_traceback()`.
- `board.LED` now consistently present on all boards that have such an LED.
- `PulseOut` no longer needs a `PWMOut`.
- Unicode filename support.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added, but several are in development.

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210824/20210824bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210824/20210824pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210824/20210824pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210824/20210824pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I revised the custom USB HID device API added in CircuitPython 7: It now allows for multiple report ID's. Now the report ID must be supplied by the creator: we no longer renumber the report ID's. This is the last incompatible change we were planning to make for the CircuitPython API, so we can start issuing beta releases for CircuitPython 7.0.0 now.

All the core developers are working on the remaining 7.0.0 issues. I closed a few that are now fixed, and am working on others.

**Jeff**

I've been mostly working on fixing bugs in the core, as well as helping Dan and Kattni put the audio fixes & mp3 file playback through its paces.

**Kattni**

This week I added MP3 playback to the MacroPad guide, finding a bug in the CircuitPython core in the process. Now, in the library, `play_file()` works with both WAV and MP3 files. This is in preparation for a MP3 Playback on RP2040 guide that includes playback using the MacroPad library, and playback on Pico using CircuitPython. That guide will be out soon, so if you're interested in playing MP3s on your RP2040, keep an eye out for that.

I published the [Adafruit MCP9601 I2C Thermocouple Amplifier guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mcp9601). The guide covers everything you need to know to get measuring with your MCP9601. There's an overview, detailed pinouts page, examples in CircuitPython and Arduino, and resource downloads. 

I also helped with moving the Learning System Guides repo to the same version of Pylint as the libraries, which meant updating from 1.9.2 to 2.7.1. Jeff set it up so it ignores all the current code, but lints all the new code. This enables us to go through and deal with the old code at our own pace versus needing to fix upwards of 1000 linting failures all at once. Dylan has been going through and linting a few at a time, so we'll have everything updated soon. This was a long time coming, and I'm really happy to see we finally did it.

Finally, I worked through renaming all of the remaining instances of CircuitPython files called main.py in the Learn repo to code.py to be in line with our standard naming convention. This involved updating all the relevant guides as well. Thanks to Dylan for helping out with the guide updates!

**Melissa**

This past week, I finally have the WebSerial ESPTool more stable and as a result I was able to get the NVM Generator code going. It has been updated to fully install the WipperSnapper binary code as well as generate and write the NVM Partition onto the board. While writing this I got inspired and came up with a simple scripting system that  allowed it to create and display each of the steps that it was currently on and it works well. You can check out the tool on [GitHub Pages](https://adafruit.github.io/Adafruit_WebSerial_NVMGenerator/).

**Scott**

This week I've been hunting bugs. The most time consuming is USB errors on the iMX RT that prevent USB from working. Low level USB reliability is a very tricky thing.

I also took a detour into enabling unicode filename support to go along with unicode being easier to enter on mobile. I've done most of the work but have hit an issue with making builds too large.

One other small tweak I made was to raise the public broadcasting transmit power for the BLE workflow so that it is easier to initially connect. Once connected, it broadcasts at full strength with an encrypted device id.
