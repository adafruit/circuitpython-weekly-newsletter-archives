## CircuitPython 7.0.0 Alpha 3 and 6.3.0 Stable Released!

[![CircuitPython 6.3.0 Released!](../assets/20210608/20210608cp67.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/01/circuitpython-6-3-0-released/)

**CircuitPython 6.3.0** is the latest minor revision of CircuitPython and is a new stable release. Notable changes since 6.2.0 include many new boards, many corrections to existing boards, the addition of a consistent board.LED to most boards - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/01/circuitpython-6-3-0-released/) and [GitHub Release Notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/6.3.0).

**CircuitPython 7.0.0-alpha.3** is an alpha release for CircuitPython 7.0.0. It is relatively stable, but contains a number of issues still to be addressed for 7.0.0. The Python API's it presents may change. Notable additions to 7.0.0 include run-time customization of USB devices, merging in of MicroPython fixes and enhancements as of MicroPython 1.15, simplifications to the RGB status LED codes, and a clocking fix for a few samples of RP2040 boards - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/03/circuitpython-7-0-0-alpha-3-released/) and [GitHub Release Notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases).

## Adafruit switching default branch of CircuitPython repositories from master to main

[![Adafruit switching default branch of CircuitPython repositories from master to main](../assets/20210608/20210608main.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/01/adafruit-switching-default-branch-of-circuitpython-repositories-from-master-to-main/)

Over the course of the next few weeks, Adafruit is switching the CircuitPython repositories to use main as their default branch instead of master. This change is a continuation of past efforts to depart from language deeply rooted in centuries of racism and the subjugation of people based on the color of their skin towards language that is inclusive of everyone. These changes have sparked others in the electronic & maker communities (SparkFun, Make, and more) to think about the history of words, how they are used, and changes we can make together - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/01/adafruit-switching-default-branch-of-circuitpython-repositories-from-master-to-main/).

Adafruit Macropad RP2040 bring-up test - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1401626793317183494).

> We put together our hopefully-final prototypes for the Macropad we're working on at the office. Now we're home and it's time to bring up the design. We like to do our bring-ups in Arduino, so we're using the Philhower Arduino core to make a definition and verify all the hardware works. The new part here is the OLED, which uses a new chipset, but similar enough to other OLEDs we wrote a driver pretty fast. This test program lights up all the switch NeoPixels tracks the rotary encoder direction and pushbutton, and scans I2C connected to the Stemma QT port. So far so good!

Macropad RP2040 bring-up part deux - CircuitPython time - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1401703835727548419).

> Now that we have my hardware validated in Arduino, it's time to get it running in CircuitPython as well. We needed to write a little patch to the core to fix a row/col swap so that the SH1106 driver will work right, however, once we got that fixed, the display/buttons/encoder are working perfectly. Next up, maybe we can get the onboard audio working so that the final PCBs can be ordered.

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210608/20210608bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I made the CircuitPython 6.3.0 final release this week, and am working on the first 7.0.0 alpha release that will be visible on circuitpython.org.

I'm continuing to work on a native module for keypad scanning in CircuitPython: We plan to support, one pin per key, matrix keypads, and shift-register-driven matrices.

I've fixed several bugs in the new customized HID device support. A user has found that there are complicated HID devices with multiple report ID's, and we've worked out a way to support those, so the API will change slightly.

**Jeff**

I've continued working on the camera code on ESP32-S2, but it doesn't work yet.  CircuitPython is able to capture data from the camera, but it's not the right data, as though the synchronization signals are being lost or ignored.

With the help of a community member, the `mpy-cross` program can now be built natively for M1 macs, and we provide a pre-built binary if for any reason you want to create mpy files on your M1 mac without building all of CircuitPython. (This applies to the development version of CircuitPython only.  For 6.x, you should still be able to use the x86_64 version on your M1 mac, it's just emulated by Rosetta 2)

I also added some scripts to our Github Actions that make sure that specific boards can be built on a Windows system with the MSYS2 build environment. We have relatively few developers & community members who are building on Windows (most use Mac or Linux, including using WSL within Windows), so it has been easy in the past to introduce problems with building CircuitPython that would not be noticed until an inconvenient moment.

**Kattni**

This week I published the Rotary Trinkey guide. It has everything you need to get started with your Rotary Trinkey including a number of CircuitPython and Arduino examples, such as: control a NeoPixel, create a volume knob, or advance through YouTube videos frame-by-frame. [Rotary Trinkey](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4964) is a great little board. If any of those things or more sound interesting to you, pick one up!

We've begun moving all of the CircuitPython library repositories on GitHub from `master` to `main` as the default branch. This is another step towards using more inclusive language in tech. We've written a [blog post[(https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/01/adafruit-switching-default-branch-of-circuitpython-repositories-from-master-to-main/) with some details.

This change will affect those folks who contribute to the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries. You will need to make sure that you’re working with the `main` branch instead of the `master` branch when you are working on library code or documentation. If you are planning on getting started contributing, we recommend starting fresh with a new clone of the repository to ensure that you have the latest updates. The Contribute to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub guide shows how to tell whether or not a library has been updated to `main`. Be aware that we are deleting the `master` branch in this process, so if you are trying to push to or sync with `master`, it will fail – this is deliberate as we do not want folks to be confused moving forward about which branch is the active one.

This past week, I have been working on guide updates. One of the guides that gave me a little more trouble than the rest was the [Raspberry Pi E-Ink Event Calendar using Python guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-e-ink-desk-calendar-using-python) because Google had completely changed the setup process on their end. I went through and updated it with many screenshots to make sure it was easy to follow along.

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on BLE workflow. Bringing the protocol into the core has exposed some timing aspects that weren't apparent in the prototype implementation. So, I've had to make the test version more robust as well as fixing internal issues. All of this testing has also highlighted missing pieces of our internal bluetooth support around reconnecting to a device we already know about. This will be done when CircuitPython does a soft reload so it's important to get reliable. When done right, it should also mean that the CP device cannot be connected to by anyone unless you put it in a discoverable mode specifically. This is the piece we missed in our previous work on BLE and will make it possible to ship it in stable versions of CircuitPython. It's important work, just in the weeds a bit.
