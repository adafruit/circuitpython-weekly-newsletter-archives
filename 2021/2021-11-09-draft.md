## Bullseye – the new version of Raspberry Pi OS - is out!

[![Bullseye – the new version of Raspberry Pi OS](../assets/20211109/20211109os.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-os-debian-bullseye/)

Raspberry Pi OS was updated Monday with a number of changes and upgrades - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-os-debian-bullseye/).

* Updated to the latest Debian 'bullseye' release (last Debian update was 2 years ago)
* The desktop components and applications are now using version 3 of the GTK+ user interface toolkit
* Uses a new window manager, called mutter, instead of the openbox window manager used in previous releases
* An integrated notification system
* Update notifications
* File manager view option simplification
* The KMS (kernel modesetting) driver is now the standard video driver
* A new camera driver
* Most applications have been upgraded to the latest version; in particular the Chromium web browser is now at version 92, and has been optimised to use the Raspberry Pi hardware to accelerate video playback.

## CircuitPython Course: Connecting a Robot Cat to the Internet

[![CircuitPython Course](../assets/20211109/20211109linkedin.jpg)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/circuitpython-connecting-a-robot-cat-to-the-internet)

In a new LinkedIn Learning course, Charlyn Gonda shows you how to use CircuitPython — a version of Python specifically for microcontrollers — to program a robot cat that reacts to events while connected to the internet. Charlyn shows how to code for common hardware devices like LEDs and servos, and explains a common messaging protocol for IoT projects called message queue telemetry transport, or MQTT. If you’re looking for an internet cat video that actually teaches you something useful, join Charlyn as she shows how to program this robot cat.

Main Course Page - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/circuitpython-connecting-a-robot-cat-to-the-internet).

The course is $34.99 after the intro chapters. But, Charlyn notes "I found a way to share it for **free**! If anyone with a linked in account [clicks the link inside this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/charlyn-g_if-youd-like-to-dip-your-toes-into-the-wonderful-activity-6862139656771923968-I7jl), they'll be able to access it for 24 hours from the time that they click the link".

[![Top programming languages](../assets/20211109/20211109lang.jpg)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/top-programming-languages-most-popular-and-fastest-growing-choices-for-developers/)

SlashData's latest Developer Nation report looks at the popularity of programming languages and trends from the global developer community. They rank JavaScript #1 (including CoffeeScript and TypeScript in that number). Python is a solid #2 ahead of Java - [ZDnet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/top-programming-languages-most-popular-and-fastest-growing-choices-for-developers/) and [Slashdot](https://developers.slashdot.org/story/21/11/07/2225252/new-study-finds-the-worlds-most-popular-programming-language-javascript).

> Python added 2.3m developers to its community in the past 12 months. "That's a 25% growth rate, one of the highest across all the large programming language communities of more than 7M users," the report noted.

## “Bare metal” CircuitPython on a Raspberry Pi, HDMI, and e-ink

[![CircuitPython on a Raspberry Pi](../assets/20211109/20211109hdmi.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/11/02/bare-metal-circuitpython-on-a-raspberry-pi-hdmi-and-e-ink/)

Scott is working on a port of CircuitPython that runs on “bare metal” on the Raspberry Pi (i.e. runs on the Pi without the Linux operating system). So of course Ladyada wanted to see what works with HDMI since the REPL is available… and she happen to have an e-ink HDMI display. It’s AWESOME.

One of the plans is to make a little computer with a keyboard, that is just CircuitPython. Write code, make art … with HDMI, have the output go to a little portable projector… kids could make cool kaleidoscopes, or make a Haiku computer that shows the last one made when the power is off since this one is e-ink - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/11/02/bare-metal-circuitpython-on-a-raspberry-pi-hdmi-and-e-ink/) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/n0HsC9ctNmM).

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20211109/20211109bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20211109/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I've gotten the MicroPython version of asyncio to work with CircuitPython, with only a few changes to the asyncio Python code, and a few changes in core CircuitPython. Our implementation of `async` and `await` is slightly different. I wrote a couple of small test programs: one blinks two LEDs at different speeds independently, and the other controls two servos in coordination in a simple way. I'll look at handling pin-change interrupts via asyncio next.

It is easy to make mistakes when writing even simple asyncio code, such as omitting an `await`. I'm looking at further wrappers to make it easier. I've found a simple implementation of task groups, and will explore using that.

**Jeff**

In your **CIRCUITPY** drive, the file `boot_out.txt` holds information about the board & CircuitPython version. Thanks to my pull request (recently merged, to appear in CircuitPython 7.1), this file will now include the text written by the board's `boot.py` initialization code (up to 512 bytes), and only be rewritten when it changes, both of which were long intended but never quite worked that way.

**Kattni**

This week has been spent finishing up the overhaul of the Welcome to CircuitPython! guide, which included a big update to the Welcome to the Community! guide as well. The overhaul is nearly done. The updated guide creates a much smoother experience for those getting started with CircuitPython. Keep an eye out for the finished update!

A new contributor reported an issue with Pylint differences locally and remotely, and it was determined that they were running a different version of Pylint than our checks are running, but it got me thinking that we had an issue with the way our checks are running on the example code, and decided we might as well update Pylint if we're going to patch the CI setup anyway. So here we are. Dylan ran a patch to fix the example code CI, and updated Pylint, and went through all of the failing libraries to fix issues related to new Pylint checks.

I also ended up down a rabbit hole with fixing some documentation issues on one library that led to realising that Read The Docs (where our docs are hosted) was running an ancient version of Sphinx (what we use to build our docs) and we were running the latest version locally. So a couple of hours were lost to figuring out what was going on, why, and how to fix it, but the fix is also included in the patch mentioned above. Current projects are running the latest on Read the Docs, but old ones were not. So that's been fixed as well.

This past week I have been fixing up the CircuitPython code editor so it is working much better on mobile devices. This includes a number of bug fixes such as the compensating for the viewport height being calculated differently on mobile devices and desktop browsers, improving the color scheme, a busy indicator when communicating over Bluetooth, improved reconnection and a number of minor bug fixes and improvements. The code is available now on https://code.circuitpython.com, but it does require the absolute newest build of CircuitPython to work.

**Scott**

This week I've been absorbed into SD card support for CircuitPython. It's taken me a couple days to confirm that I'm outputting to the wires to the SD card. Now that I've done that, I've been working to support the initialization of the card. It's a common algorithm and I've been hoping to have a shared code base for it. Thanks to everyone on Twitter who has pointed me to different implementations. Hopefully soon we'll have a TinyUSB-like library for managing SD and EMMC cards.
