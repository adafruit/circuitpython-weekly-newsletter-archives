[![Metro iMX RT1011](../assets/20210330/20210330dvdbounce.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb5Yj9iPYYk)

We're playing around, testing things on the upcoming [Metro M7](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4950). This time we're doing a TFT shield demo to test out displayio and our ILI9341 driver. We made a fun bouncing DVD demo with transparent pixels. Our code allows a dynamic number of DVD logos for bouncing pleasure. Mostly this is us seeing how a 500 MHz processor feels with CircuitPython! Still lots to do, but this code is working pretty well, no crashing. - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb5Yj9iPYYk).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week we had X new boards added!

- [Unexpected Maker Tiny S2](https://circuitpython.org/board/unexpectedmaker_tinys2/)

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210330/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 6.2.0-beta.4 on March 18. This version is close to what we want in the final 6.2.0. There are few more fixes we'd like to get in, but the next release is likely to be a release candidate.

When we make releases, we reorder the boards on [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org) in order of most frequently downloaded. We've been doing this in only a semi-automated way: the process includes downloading tens or hundreds of thousands of log files from Amazon S3, and then running a script. I explored some other services available on Amazon Web Services, and found that I could enable fancier logging and then run SQL queries against those logs directly on AWS. I have experimented with this and it's working well. This is very far afield from embedded programming but is an interesting diversion for me.

**Jeff**

Work continues on support for the i.MX series of microcontrollers, which will be in the upcoming Metro M7 RT1011 board.

Right now I'm concentrating on the SPI peripheral. The next enhancement I'll work on is to use "DMA" to speed up busio.SPI. Without this, there are long delays between each byte of data that greatly limit the total throughput and which can also make displayio update slowly.

**Kattni**

This week I published the Python for Microcontrollers newsletter for the first time without Anne's excellent assistance. She trained me up over the past few weeks, and helped a lot with content for the recent newsletter. This newsletter is my first one completely solo. I hope I have managed to keep it up to expectations!

In product-guide-land, I published the [Adafruit CYBERDECK Hat and Bonnet guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/cyberdeck-bonnet-and-hat/pinouts) and the [Adafruit MIDI FeatherWing guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-midi-featherwing) this week, though the FeatherWing guide was done up a while ago. If you're looking to get started with either product, check out these guides for details.

Otherwise, I'm continuing to work on creating templates for the CircuitPython Essentials guide so we can include them in the CircuitPython-compatible microcontroller guides and have a much smoother, more tailored experience for folks who are getting started with CircuitPython. I have two templates completed, and am working on a third. None of the CircuitPython template pages are published yet, so I don't have an example for you. I will soon!

**Lucian**

This past week I finally pinned down and made a big todo list of the remaining issues I was having with the low power module, including a couple redundant parts of the API, issues with how reset impacts write protection on the STM32's clock, and conflicts within how Circuitpython decides whether it will enter "real" deep sleep (the true low power mode) and "fake" deep sleep (where it avoids disconnecting from USB). 

I also reviewed incoming modules for low power on NRF, AudioPWMIO, and some miscellaneous bugfixes to UDP sockets and the SPI sharing system used on the Meowbit. I'm hoping I'll be all through the current NRF/STM32 sleep projects this week, so I can start work on RP2040 sleep - having these three ports, plus the ESP32-S2, should be a good foundation for our next major version.

**Melissa**

This week, I got familiar with the inner workings of the bundle releases and made a 2-part dynamic bundler. First I added some code that generates a JSON file that contains all of the information in the Bundle. It is currently being attached as part of a release. This includes all of the dependency information.

The other part of this is a JavaScript application that allows you to specify the libraries that you would like included. It then downloads the JSON file, figures out the dependencies of the libraries that you would like, downloads the release bundle, extracts the files that you want in your dynamic bundle and repackages everything up into its own zip file and initiates a download. When I started, I knew it was theoretically possible, but was pleased to see it all working.

One of the issues I ran into was a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy limitation. The problem is when trying to download GitHub release assets, it doesn't like it if the domains don't match, even if using GitHub pages. I was temporarily able to work around this by using a CORS proxy, but this isn't a good long term solution. I am currently looking into more reliable methods such as using Amazon S3.

**Scott**

This week I wrapped up the RP2040 flash settings changes. Overall, I'm really happy with how it turned out. I'm wrapping up RP2040 work this week by looking at a couple bugs and then will be moving to iMX RT briefly to bring the flash config there as well. It's forcing a bit more of an expansion because both CircuitPython and TinyUF2 have the iMX RT flash config in it.

After that, I'll be moving to nRF work for BLE workflow and collaborating with Trevor who will be doing the iOS side. I'm very excited to start on it but a bit daunted by all the work I want to do. It'll be nice to work with someone else to help focus where to start.
