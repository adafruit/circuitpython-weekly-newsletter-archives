## Study about the impact of open source software and hardware on technological independence, competitiveness and innovation in the EU economy

[![Study about the impact of open source software and hardware on technological independence, competitiveness and innovation in the EU economy](../assets/20210914/20210914eu.jpg)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-about-impact-open-source-software-and-hardware-technological-independence-competitiveness-and)

This study aims to investigate the economic impact of Open Source Software and Hardware on the EU economy. Open Source Software (OSS) has become mainstream across all sectors of the software industry over the past decade. Conversely, the level of maturity of Open Source Hardware (OSH) currently appears far lower. However, the business ecosystem for OSH is developing fast. If OSH is to follow the same development as OSS, it could constitute a cornerstone of the future Internet of Things (IoT), the future of computing and the digital transformation of the European industry at the end of the digital decade.

The objective of the study was to investigate and quantify the economic impact of OSS and OSH on the European economy. The study also identified strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges of open source in relevant ICT policies, such as cybersecurity, artificial intelligence (AI), digitising European industry, the connected car, high performance computing, big data, distributed ledger technologies, and more.

See the [Summary](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-about-impact-open-source-software-and-hardware-technological-independence-competitiveness-and) and the [Report (pdf)](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/79021).

## Push the Button – a Handy Bluetooth Button

[![Push the Button](../assets/20210914/20210914push.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/09/09/push-the-button-a-handy-bluetooth-button-feather-circuitpython-bluetooth-ble-blitzcitydiy-sophywong/)

A wonderful collaboration between makers Sophy Wong and Blitz City DIY has produced the handheld “Push the Button” box. Inside the box is an Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express board programmed in CircuitPython to take the button input and send commands out via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When the box is paired with a mobile phone playing songs, you have a complete solution for controlling your tunes without having to touch the phone.

Sophy designed the case and cover with Blitz City 3D printing the case in yellow and Sophy milling one out of aluminum. The CircuitPython code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BlitzCityDIY/pushTheButton).

You can see [Sophy’s video](https://youtu.be/2B4BU1NuXvE) on the case design and the [Blitz City DIY video](https://youtu.be/i17e8ODk7xg) on the electronics design - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/09/09/push-the-button-a-handy-bluetooth-button-feather-circuitpython-bluetooth-ble-blitzcitydiy-sophywong/).

## Bluetooth 5.3 Specification Switches to More Inclusive Terminology

[![More Inclusive Terminology](../assets/20210914/20210914ble.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/09/08/bluetooth-5-3-specification-switches-to-more-inclusive-terminology/)

Last month, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) released an Appropriate Language Mapping Table v6 document describing the changes to the Bluetooth 5.3 Specification.

From the introduction - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/09/08/bluetooth-5-3-specification-switches-to-more-inclusive-terminology/).

> For more than 20 years, the Bluetooth SIG has brought together a global community of innovators to build a more connected world. We are committed to continuing to foster a global community characterized by inclusion and mutual respect.<br> <br>In the pursuit of this, starting in August 2020, certain terms that were identified as inappropriate are now being replaced. The original terms may still exist in specifications that are already adopted. However, updates to adopted specifications and all new specifications use replacement terms. This document contains tables that map original and replacement terms.<br> <br>To match the replaced term in a newer adopted specification with the original term in an older adopted specification, locate the mapping table that corresponds to the applicable Bluetooth technology.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added but several are forthcoming.

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210914/20210914bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210914/20210914pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210914/20210914pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210914/20210914pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210914/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I am back from vacation, working on the final few things we need to finish for 7.0.0 final. I fixed an RP2040 I2SOut issue, and thought there was another software audio quality issue, but it turned out to be a wiring/grounding problem. The moral is to try the simplest possible wiring before concluding the issue is software.

**Jeff**

I've been on vacation, but that vacation included a trip to Adafruit Headquarters. You may have seen me on Ask an Engineer. Next week I'll return to my regular work schedule and continue with anything that needs fixing as we approach 7.0.0.

This past week was a short week for me. I helped Melissa out with the 1.69" Round Rectangle TFT display guide. I finished updating the [INA219 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ina219-current-sensor-breakout/overview) for the STEMMA QT revision of the board. The QT version has been out for a while, but the guide was never updated. Now there are Pinouts, new wiring diagrams, and new Downloads resources for the current version of the board.

I found a bug in CircuitPython for RP2040 regarding WAV and tone playback using I2S while working on the I2S template. Dan already figured out a fix and it's been merged. So, I'll now be able to continue working on that template. The first guide it will be in is the MP3 Playback on RP2040 guide, with Pico as the example board (the testing of which is how I found the bug in the first place). Keep an eye out for that!

This past week, I worked on a fixing issues on GitHub focusing mostly on the Raspberry Pi scripts. I fixed the Pinning script which wasn't working with more recent versions of the kernel due to a version string format change. I also worked on with Kattni to get the [Adafruit 1.69" 280x240 Round Rectangle Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-69-280x240-round-rectangle-color-ips-tft-display) guide written.

This week has been a mix of updating the BLE workflow to handle file modification times and bug hunting. Mainly, I got the BLE_File_Transfer library updated with the modification time support and the new move command. I'm now getting that working in core CircuitPython but need to tweak the protocol to work better on ARM by aligning the 64-bit field better.

Bug-wise, I fixed a bug with scanning while the workflow is advertising. I copied a fix for GCC 11.2 and the nrf bootloader into CircuitPython to fix it similarly. I also released CircuitPython 7.0.0-rc.1 for testing.

As a break from BLE and bugs I modified the CircuitPython continuous build to only build boards related to the changed files. This should reduce our usage and shorten how long it takes to get results back. See more about this on my Deep Dive from [last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8qQi2P4g_U).
