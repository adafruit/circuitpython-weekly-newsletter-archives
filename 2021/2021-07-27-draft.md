CircuitPython 7.0.0-alpha.5, has been released. It is relatively stable, but contains a number of issues still to be addressed for 7.0.0. The Python API’s it presents may change.

Notable additions to 7.0.0 since 6.3.0 include:

* Support for the CircuitPython development workflow over BLE.
* Camera support on ESP32S2.
* The `keypad` key-scanning module.
* Run-time customization of USB devices.
* Merging in of MicroPython fixes and enhancements as of MicroPython 1.16.
* `_pixelbuf` is now `adafruit_pixelbuf`.
* `colorwheel()` routine moved to `rainbowio`.
* `supervisor.ticks_ms()` to allow easier time-keeping.
* Simplifications to the RGB status LED codes.
* A clocking fix for a few samples of RP2040 boards.

In this past Sunday's Desk of Ladyada, there are Stemma QT redesigns of the SCD40/SCD41 and IS31FL3741 chips and redesigning some recent boards like the Matrix Portal to use ESP32-S2 - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SCGWb46x7E).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added, but several are in development.

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210727/20210727bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210727/20210727pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210727/20210727pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210727/20210727pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210727/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.0.0-alpha.5 on Wednesday, July 21. The CircuitPython core team went through all the 7.0.0 issues, trimmed the list a bit, and are now resolving the issues. Of course new issues also appear to fix, but we're making good progress.

**Jeff**

Using the new NeoKey 5x6 Ortho Snap-Apart and a Feather S2, I verified that the new keypad module works on the ESP32-S2 series of microcontrollers.

I also added a JPEG capture mode to the OV2640 camera library for CircuitPython. The whole JPEG has to be temporarily stored in RAM before it is written to an SD card, so the ESP32-S2 with generous PSRAM is a good choice and can capture 2-megapixel JPEG images.

**Kattni**

I published the [Adafruit TCA4307 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tca4307). The TCA4307 is a hot-swap I2C buffer. I2C isn't hot-swappable by itself, but STEMMA QT connectors make it really convenient to do, and that's where the TCA4307 comes in. This was a quick guide, as there's no code to go with it. It includes an Overview, Pinouts, example wiring diagram, and Downloads resources.

I also wrote up an example for Noe and Pedro for their [MacroPad Braille Keycaps](https://learn.adafruit.com/macropad-braille-keycaps) guide that plays a tone for each key for an added level of accessibility. 

We did the Hackaday Hackchat on Wednesday. We discussed DIY keyboards and CircuitPython keyboard support. We answered a lot of questions and gave away a fun Hackaday custom keycap to a few folks towards the end.

The highlight of my week, though, was levelling up my contributions to the CircuitPython core. I renamed `_pixelbuf` to `adafruit_pixelbuf` (and aliased it back for backwards compatibility) to match the new Python version of `adafruit_pixelbuf` which will eventually simplify the NeoPixel and DotStar libraries. I had help from Dan and Jeff. It's my biggest core contribution to date. I learned a lot and enjoyed dipping my toes into the core.

**Melissa**

This past week, I worked on add Blinka Support to the BeagleV Starlight, which is a beta prototype not yet available to the general public. I was able to get GPIO and I2C functioning which covers a great deal of add-on boards. I didn't test UART, though it would likely work with PySerial. I also spent some time working on some GitHub issues which were focussed on CircuitPython 7.0 compatibility with some of the libraries.

**Scott**

At the end of last week Dan, Jeff, Kattni and I went through open 7.0.0 issues to categorize them and then also the open pull requests. We got the 7.0.0 milestone down to ~40 issues and divided them among us. Since then, I've been getting changes merged to fix the issues assigned to me. We're squashing the bugs to get us closer to the 7.0.0 stable release. It shouldn't be too far away now. Please file an issue if you are having issues with the latest alpha (version 5 at the moment.)

We also closed a number of pull requests and only had three left open. I think it's been over a year at least since we were that low. We tend to worry if we have more than 20 open so this is exciting!

All-in-all we're making good progress on 7.0.0. Once I'm through my bugs I'll be circling back to BLE workflow stuff. It still needs polish.
