## Texas Instruments Answers Questions on their New TI-84 Plus CE Python Graphing Calculator, and an Update: the Calculator uses an ATSAMD21 chip as a CircuitPython Coprocessor

[![TI Calculator](../assets/20210629/20210629ti.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/25/adafruit-interviews-texas-instruments-education-about-python-on-calculators-and-more-ticalculators-ticodes/)

In May of 2021, Adafruit saw that there was a fork of CircuitPython reported to be running on the new TI-84 Plus CE Python Graphing Calculator by Texas Instruments and they had to get one (and did!). Adafruit then reached out to the folks at TI Education / TI Calculators and asked if they could send over some questions to their team(s) and they said YES. See the questions and responses - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/25/adafruit-interviews-texas-instruments-education-about-python-on-calculators-and-more-ticalculators-ticodes/)

Plus: the calculator is running a fork of CircuitPython on a ATMEL (Microchip) ATSAMD21E18 (the same chip as the Adafruit GEMMA M0, TRINKET M0, and many TRINKEYs) - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/25/adafruit-interviews-texas-instruments-education-about-python-on-calculators-and-more-ticalculators-ticodes/).

## keypad: support for vector and matrix key scanning in CircuitPython

[![keypad](../assets/20210629/20210629key.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/4891)

Dan Halbert has completed initial work on a comprehensive keypad module for CircuitPython - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/4891) and [Adafruit Blog/YouTube](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/20/circuitpython-speedy-keyswitch-handling/).

The `keypad` module provides three different ways to scan a set keys, provided by the classes `Keys` (one key per pin), `KeyMatrix` (row/column matrix), and `ShiftRegisterKeys` (external shift registers). Key scanning is done in the background and includes debouncing. Key transition events (pressed or released) are put on a queue, implemented by classes `Event` and `EventQueue`.

## Microcontroller Shortages Projected into 2022

[![Microcontroller Shortages](../assets/20210629/20210629short1.jpg)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-22/wait-times-for-chips-stretch-further-deepening-shortage)

[![Microcontroller Shortages](../assets/20210629/20210629short2.jpg)](https://www.eenewseurope.com/news/chip-shortage-last-2022-says-gartner)

Shortages of microcontrollers, used to run millions of devices worldwide, are acute and projected to last into next year. Chips from Microchip/Atmel, Nordic, ST and others are affected. Due to timing, the new Raspberry Pi RP2040 and ESP chips from Espressif Systems do not seem as impacted at the moment.

The shortages have led developers to scour the internet for dwindling supplies. For chips that are unobtainable, some products are being redesigned using more easily available microcontrollers, which can be a costly hardware and software process - [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/the-global-chip-shortage-could-last-until-2023-.html), [EE News Europe](https://www.eenewseurope.com/news/all-one-embedded-software-stack-help-chip-shortage), [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4435264-microchip-technology-benefiting-from-strong-microcontroller-demand-and-shortages-mchp), and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-22/wait-times-for-chips-stretch-further-deepening-shortage).

## Camera support coming to CircuitPython on ESP32-S2

[![Camera support coming to CircuitPython on ESP32-S2](../assets/20210629/20210629camera.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/22/camera-support-coming-to-circuitpython-on-esp32-s2/)

Testing the ESP32-S2 Kaluga dev kit v1.3 with the [latest PR from Jeff](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/4880) to add native camera support to CircuitPython. In only a few lines of code it can initialize a display, read a buffer from the camera, then blit it out to the onboard 240x320 screen. There are now libraries for both OV7670 and the nicer/newer [OV2640](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_OV2640). Amazing work by the team to get this so smooth! - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/22/camera-support-coming-to-circuitpython-on-esp32-s2/) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/3qTod5rLvnw).

## An online editor for CircuitPython

[![Online editor for CircuitPython](../assets/20210629/20210629ide.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/22/an-online-editor-for-circuitpython-circuitpython/)

YouTube user River Wang [posts](https://youtu.be/Z44PD-ZleAU) about a CircuitPython online IDE, which is web-based, requiring zero software setup. This would be ideal for any computer, but especially for machines where installing additional software is not possible such as at libraries, public spaces, and on school Chromebooks - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/06/22/an-online-editor-for-circuitpython-circuitpython/), [GitHub](https://github.com/urfdvw/CircuitPython-online-IDE), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Z44PD-ZleAU) and [try it out here](https://urfdvw.github.io/CircuitPython-online-IDE/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added but several are being developed!

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210629/20210629bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

By the time you read this, the keypad module will have been merged into main in CircuitPython. I'll be writing a Learn Guide on how to use it, with examples including the new MacroPad product and reading the buttons from an SNES controller.

I'm back to fixing bugs for 7.0.0. First stop is to fix some audio problems on the RP2040.

**Jeff**

I merged MicroPython 1.16 into the main branch of CircuitPython. This gets us the newest bug-fixes to the core language & more.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Adafruit Trinkey QT2040](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinkey-qt2040) guide. It has everything you need to get started with your QT2040 Trinkey, including examples for CircuitPython, U2IF Python and Arduino, as well as pinouts and downloads resources. If you picked up one of these little boards and need some assistance or ideas, check out this guide!

Related, I updated the MCP9808 guide to include the STEMMA QT version of the breakout, with wiring diagrams and resource downloads now available.

I also helped write up a CircuitPython Community Code of Conduct for folks who are submitting libraries to the community bundle. Our `cookiecutter` was adding the Adafruit Community CoC, but this did not make sense as it includes things that do not apply to projects maintained by community members. Now, when you use `cookiecutter` and choose "Community" for the library type, you'll get a CoC that applies to your project. If you've already generated a library and submitted it to the bundle, consider checking out the version now included with `cookiecutter`, and updating your library with the new CoC.

**Lucian**

This past week I've been working on the updates to the "Set Next File" feature, which will allow users to do things like pick a file out of a menu and soft-reboot circuitpython into running that file. This concept got put down for a while, and I've been reworking it to fit the new state of Circuitpython's main branch with all the new additions to sleep, status LED, and run reasons. 

While catching it up has been relatively simple, the concept runs aground a bit when it comes to deep sleep - since a board in true deep sleep is almost in a reset state, losing all access to RAM, we have to figure out how to store the name of the next file to run if this feature is going to work. I didn't like the idea of having "sub-programs" simply return to the menu after using deep sleep, since that would mean they act differently just by virtue of being a sub-program; an imported example that uses sleep should act the same whether it's been called from a menu or not. This will take a bit of extra tooling work this week, but I think the result should be worth the effort.

**Melissa**

This past week I mostly worked on the WebSerial ESPTool a bit more. I ended up decoupling the core code from the user interface code to make it a bit more modular and easier to use with different user interfaces. This allows it to be more extensible and work in additional ways than it was originally intended. This was important because it planned to be used in an upcoming project.

**Scott**

I'm back from vacation and caught up. Now I'm dusting off the BLE workflow changes and getting them ready for review. Things are looking good so the PR should be out soon. Next, I'll be hooking up CircuitPython's serial connection to a BLE UART service so it too is accessible over BLE.
