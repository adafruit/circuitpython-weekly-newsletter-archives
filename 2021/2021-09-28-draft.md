## Wippersnapper Official Beta Released

[![Welcome to WipperSnapper](../assets/20210928/20210928wippersnapper.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/09/27/new-guide-welcome-to-wippersnapper-adafruitlearningsystem-nocode-iot-adafruit/)

WipperSnapper is an interface for Adafruit IO, the incredibly easy-to-use IoT platform, designed to turn any WiFi-capable board into an IoT device without programming a single line of code. 

[A new guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/quickstart-adafruit-io-wippersnapper/) walks through the process of installing WipperSnapper on a development board, a brief overview of the WipperSnapper platform, and instructions for adding (and interacting with) physical components from the web - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/09/27/new-guide-welcome-to-wippersnapper-adafruitlearningsystem-nocode-iot-adafruit/).

## Emulate a vintage ROM or EPROM with a Raspberry Pi Pico

[![Emulate a vintage ROM or EPROM with a Raspberry Pi Pico and CircuitPython](../assets/20210928/20210928rom.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/09/24/emulate-a-vintage-rom-or-eprom-with-a-raspberry-pi-pico-and-circuitpython-circuitpython-piday-raspberrypipico-e14community-baldengineer/)

The Apple IIe uses a custom microcontroller and ROM chip to put ASCII values from the keyboard into the computer’s memory. How can this function be emulated? The Bald Engineer tries an Arduino Mega 2560 and Teensy 4.0 before finding the inexpensive Raspberry Pi Pico up to the task. Programmed PIO handled the tight timing while CircuitPython controls the data flow and allows for quick programming and debug - [Element14](https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-92059/l/episode-517-emulate-an-eprom-how-hard-could-it-be?CMP=SOM-TWITTER-PRG-E14PRESENTS-EP517), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/XyMrzPP4KBk) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/09/24/emulate-a-vintage-rom-or-eprom-with-a-raspberry-pi-pico-and-circuitpython-circuitpython-piday-raspberrypipico-e14community-baldengineer/).

## Python 3.10.0rc2 is Available with Helpful Error Text

[![Python 3.10.0rc2](../assets/20210928/20210928in.jpg)](https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/2021/09/python-3100rc2-is-available.html)

Python 3.10 is scheduled to be released October 4th - [Python Insider](https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/2021/09/python-3100rc2-is-available.html).

[Luciano R on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ramalhoorg/status/1440399500804116488) summarizes a great new feature:

> I love Python's new user-friendly error messages!!! In Python 3.10rc2: <br> <br>
`NameError: name 'results_count' is not defined. Did you mean: 'result_count'?`<br>
<br> Thank you so much [Pablo Galindo](https://twitter.com/pyblogsal) and everyone else who is contributing to make Python more and more friendly!

Apparently the user friendly messages were inspired by Rust which was inspired by Elm.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there was one new board added:

- [Shake RP2040](https://circuitpython.org/board/melopero_shake_rp2040/)

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210928/20210928bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210928/20210928pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210928/20210928pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210928/20210928pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210928/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.0.0 final on Monday, September 20. Thanks to everyone who contributed to and tested the alpha, beta, and RC releases leading up to this final release.

I'm now working on a backlog of HID-related tasks for 7.1.0 or later. I hope to add boot-protocol keyboards. I'm also working on an example of an HID radial controller. The Microsoft Surface Dial is the most well-known such controller.

**Jeff**

I added a timestamping feature to key Event objects, so that CircuitPython code can tell when a keypress was registered, even if it's not reacted to immediately.

I also worked on improving parallel LCD support in the ESP32-S2. My original goal was to get the display of the Espressif HMI Devkit working, but I wasn't able to reach it. However, there's a coming enhancement for 8-bit displays that will make them faster than now using the I2S peripheral of the ESP32-S2.

**Kattni**

This week CircuitPython 7.0.0 stable was released, which means `rainbowio` is now available in a stable release! So, it meant it was time to go through all of the Learn examples and remove any references to `_pixelbuf` and `pypixelbuf`, as well as all instances of the `wheel()` function, and replace them with `colorwheel()` from `rainbowio`! There were 72 files modified in the Learn repo, and a further 5 libraries required example updates. It's exciting for me because `rainbowio` was my first core code contribution, so I'm really stoked to see it being used.

**Melissa**

This past week, I was out sick for a couple of days, so I didn't end up getting as much done as usual. I also ended up having to delay the 2.9" eInk guide for a bit that I had worked on because the newer eInk flexible display needed a new driver written for it in CircuitPython and Python. So I ended up writing that and updated the guide. The guide is now live [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-9-eink-display-breakouts-and-featherwings).

**Scott**

This week I've been sucked into Cortex-A land on the Raspberry Pi. My goal is to bring TinyUSB and then CircuitPython to the Raspberry Pi 4s. I've got debugging over JTAG working and [designed a PCB](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/fBq76nP9) to make it easy to connect to. I'll test it when I receive it. I've also figured out how to catch crashes and determine the reason. This is huge for debugging and fixing things. I used QEMU running the code too but found it doesn't mimic alignment checks like the real one does. So, my next step is getting the memory mapping unit (MMU) configured correctly so that strlen will work. At that point, I hope I'll have debug printing working. If you've done Cortex-A programming, then please ping me [on Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). I'd love some more eyes on the code.
