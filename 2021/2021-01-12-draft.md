## CircuitPython Blinka for Single Board Computers Explained

[![CircuitPython Blinka](../assets/20210112/20210112blinka.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/blinka)

The CircuitPython.Org website has been updated to include an explanation of what the [CircuitPython Blinka compatibility layer](https://circuitpython.org/blinka) for SBCs is:

> Blinka brings CircuitPython APIs and, therefore, CircuitPython libraries to single board computers (SBCs). It is a [pip installable Python library](https://pypi.org/project/Adafruit-Blinka/) that runs in normal "desktop" Python. The CircuitPython runtime isn't used. [CircuitPython libraries](https://pypi.org/search/?q=adafruit-circuitpython) can also be installed via pip. 

See the [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux) for further details.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week no new boards were added but several are in the works.

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210112/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **290**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I made a CircuitPython 6.1.0-rc.0 release this week, after consultation with Scott and Jeff. There are many fixes and additions past 6.0.1. There are still some significant bugs I'd like to see fixed soon, and I'm working on those. I'm on the trail of a memory overwrite that seems to be causing problems with time.sleep().

**Jeff**

Back in December I added support for binary ".pcf" files to the adafruit_bitmap_font library. These fonts take up less space on your device's CIRCUITPY drive and are also faster to load into RAM. However, there was no convenient converter from ".bdf" format to ".pcf". I changed that this week with a [web-based converter](https://adafruit.github.io/web-bdftopcf/) and wrote a [short guide page about using it](https://learn.adafruit.com/custom-fonts-for-pyportal-circuitpython-display/convert-to-pcf). This is especially handy for battery-powered MagTag projects, since less time spent loading fonts means more time in Deep Sleep so the battery will last for longer between charges.

**Kattni**

I started a library PR/issue sweep and started to reach out to folks on library PRs to see where everyone is at. If you're waiting on a reply to a PR, and it's been more than 24 hours (not including weekends), feel free to tag whomever you're waiting on - we're all getting caught up after the holiday. In guide land, I updated the CCS811 guide with the STEMMA QT revision of the board. I wrote the guide for the new [Adafruit SCD30](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4867) as well which has all the details about the board that you need to get started with it.

**Lucian**

This past week I've wrapped up my Flashcard guide on the MagTag, and have been diving into Socket behavior in CPython in hopes of bringing Circuitpython closer in terms of error reporting and performance. I've also been looking into other bugs on my list, related to Busio and other peripherals across several ports.

**Melissa**

This past week I was back from the holiday break and worked on catching up on GitHub Pull Requests and issues that had been submitted while I was gone. I continued working on refactoring the PyPortal library that I had started before the break. One of the things I was stuck on was updating how it handled images and I realized that the MatrixPortal and MagTag libraries weren't actually handling image downloads, so I changed my focus to expanding the functionality of those libraries at the same time.

**Scott**

Mainly I [kicked off #circuitpython2021 on the blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/01/01/where-should-circuitpython-go-in-2021-circuitpython2021-circuitpython/) and then [followed up](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/01/05/circuitpython2021-tuesday-round-up/) with the first answers from folks.

Besides that, not a whole lot to report. I'm getting caught up after the holidays.

Will be doing a deep dive on Fridays at 2 pm Pacific again!
