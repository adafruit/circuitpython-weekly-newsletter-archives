## Python on hardware in Gartner Embedded Software and Systems report! Now in the “Slope of Enlightenment”

[![Gartner Chart](../assets/20210601/20210601gartner.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/05/27/python-on-hardware-in-gartner-embedded-software-and-systems-report-now-in-the-slope-of-enlightenment/)

Research firm Gartner has noted that Python on hardware has passed all the hype and now is becoming mainstream in hardware development.

> “Position and Adoption Speed Justification: Python is a high-level programming language, suited to fast development and easy maintenance. MicroPython brought these advantages to an embedded environment and led to the creation of CircuitPython (which extends support to Adafruit’s popular range of embedded platforms) …” 
“Python was originally heralded as an ideal language for educational applications, being selected as the default development environment for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. MicroPython provides a subset of the Python language but replicates the structure and syntax so that developers can take their skills and their applications into low-end hardware. Support for MicroPython has been steadily increasing with the processing power available in embedded systems. We also see more API libraries and peripheral support being added.”
“User Advice: Adopt MicroPython to accelerate development and reduce development costs if time to market is critical. As an interpreted language, Python requires more processing power than low-level languages, so it requires boards with 32-bit microcontrollers. This limitation has become less important as IoT increasingly adopts 32-bit microcontrollers for most applications.”

Garter noticing Python on hardware is a big deal, and this is a report from last year, there is A LOT more that has happened and is happening now. From Python on calculators to 200+ boards Adafruit has that supports Python on hardware. It’s also worth noting that MicroPython moved to a better position in Garter’s report year over year (2019 to 2020 too). Gartner also did a good job summarizing why Python on hardware can accelerate development and reduce development costs.

## Python back at second position on the TIOBE Programming Popularity Index

[![TIOBE Index for May 2021](../assets/20210601/20210601tiobe.jpg)](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)

Last November, Python briefly swapped positions with Java for the second position in the TIOBE index. This month Python strikes again. The difference is only 0.13%, but it is reasonable to assume that Python will keep its second position for a longer time now. It might be even heading for the first place of the TIOBE index in the next half year, because C is (just like Java) losing popularity - [TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).

## Machine Learning on the Edge with Adafruit & Microsoft Lobe

[![Ladaada demonstrates Microsoft Lobe](../assets/20210601/20210601lobe.jpg)](**https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/**https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/05/29/bakery-machine-learning-on-the-edge-with-adafruit-microsoft-lobe/)

Machine learning is a transformative tool that’s redefining how we build software — but up until now, it was only accessible to a small group of experts. Adafruit thinks machine learning should be accessible to everyone, that’s why they partnered with Microsoft and their Lobe platform for an easy to use machine learning kit using the Adafruit Braincraft hardware for Raspberry Pi, to bring people's machine learning ideas to life – [video](https://youtu.be/O6KdTTdioTY).

Ladyada appeared in the Microsoft Build keynote with Kevin Scott, CTO of Microsoft - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ML0s-T55VPA) and  more info on the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/05/29/bakery-machine-learning-on-the-edge-with-adafruit-microsoft-lobe/)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210601/20210601bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210601/20210601pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210601/20210601pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

This week I released CircuitPython 6.3.0-rc.0, Release Candidate 0. If there are no serious bugs revealed, this release will become 6.3.0 final, which we would release early next week after the US holiday on Monday. We try to avoid doing stable releases late in the week or over a weekend or holiday so that we can be available for support. Once 6.3.0 final is released, we will start doing 7.0.0 alpha releases.

I have started to work on a native (C code) matrix keypad module, which you'll be able to use for many kinds of keyboard scanning, including just a few buttons, macro keypads, typing keyboards, or even some kinds of music keyboards.

**Jeff**

After taking a week off, I'm back and finishing up adding the rgbmatrix module to our esp32s2 boards. In CircuitPython 7, you'll be able to do a LED matrix+WiFi project without needing an AirLift module.

**Kattni**

This week I published the NeoKey Trinkey guide. It has everything you need to get started with your NeoKey Trinkey, including pinouts, examples and resource downloads. I also added a CircuitPython page to the Rotary QT guide.

The SAMD21 boards are up for PrettyPins, so the Neo Trinkey and the NeoKey Trinkey are done, and as time permits, I'll continue on down that list.

Next up is the Rotary Trinkey guide. Keep an eye out for that coming soon!

**Lucian**

This week I got bogged down with bugs in the PinAlarm module for the upcoming RP2040 sleep module, which have been causing erratic failures on the pullups, unexpected wakeups, and constant restarting after the code.py file has been saved. I've been working through it by building some reliable control tests and diving further into the GPIO, power and watchdog register documentation, though it wasn't helped by getting knocked out some vaccination travel and side effects. I'm hoping to still get through all of it this week, and finally put down sleep for a little while!

**Melissa**

This past week, I was mostly catching up on GitHub issues that had been accumulating due to all the guide writing I was doing. One of the items I was testing out was the new Beaglebone StarFive with Blinka. At this point there's still a lot of work to do to get it going. I also went through the boards on [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org) and updated the images as well as added a few missing boards.

**Scott**

This week I've been working on the CircuitPython side of the BLE file transfer service. This service is a core piece of the "BLE workflow" that will enable folks to program a CircuitPython wirelessly over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE is commonly used by phones and tablets to communicate to other devices.

I've gotten advertising and connecting working. Now I'm working on implementing the protocol pieces. I've written code for each command in the protocol and my next step is to test each one. I'm also finding issues in the Glider app when doing this too and will fix them as well.
