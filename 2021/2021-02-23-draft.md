## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210223/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **300**!

**New Libraries!**

Here's this week's new CircuitPython libraries:

 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE_LYWSD03MMC](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE_LYWSD03MMC)

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

* This week the list was too long to include!

## What’s the team up to this week?

Here's what the CircuitPython team has been up to this past week:

**Dan**

I finished the secondary USB serial implementation for CircuitPython and will be submitting a PR shortly. Its API tries to be an approximate subset of the `pyserial` API.

Another CircuitPython 6.2.0 beta will be in the works soon.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20210223/20210223jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I turned the corner on PIO and have implemented something useful---the ability to control 8 strands of NeoPixels in parallel using the PIO peripheral, 3 GPI pins, and a '595 "shift register".  Advantages of this feature include transmitting data to the neopixels in less time, and more freedom in how you wire multiple NeoPixel strips -- in serial, or now in parallel. Once incorporated in CircuitPython, it will work similarly to Pixelbuf and can automatically be used by the Animation library.

**Kattni**

This week I was able to get a bit of miscellaneous done including blogging some guide releases, fixing some guide page layouts, and updating some old code for the latest CircuitPython release. I added two concepts to the Welcome to CircuitPython guide - the CIRCUITPY filesystem use and what happens when your code is done running. I'm now working on finalising the [Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Pico and CircuitPython guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython) with two more pages: Potentiometer and PWM LED, and Data Logger. Those pages should be live soon. Next up - updating the MLX90393 guide for the STEMMA QT revision. Keep an eye out for those over the next week!

**Lucian**

This past week I worked on some of the persistent I2C errors that have been affecting the ESP32-S2 port, which cause either mysterious crashes or conflicts with WiFi, depending on how the peripheral is reset. I also got started on putting together control tests and other infrastructure for the low power modes on the STM32 port, along with a number of miscellaneous minor bugfixes and PR adjustments.

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on several miscellaneous GitHub issues including fixing some of the Raspberry Pi installer scripts and attempting to get the ST7789 display driver working. While the driver did compile on the newer headers, it was still experiencing some drawing issues.

Next I wrote up a guide on the 1.54" E-Ink display. I was working on a mega guide a while ago, but it really makes sense to split the displays up into several guides. You can check out the [E-Ink display guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-54-eink-display-breakouts).

**Scott**

This week I'm wrapping with PIO improvements that I've made for I2S audio playback support. I've gotten it working and will PR it by the end of this week. (I'm hoping to do PDM microphone input as well.)

Next week I hope to get UART going on the RP2040 and `rotaryio`. Folks have been eagerly awaiting both so I hope I can knock them out.

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/20210223/codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
