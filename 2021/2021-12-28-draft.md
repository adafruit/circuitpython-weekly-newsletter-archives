Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## Guest editor this week - pt !

[![title](../assets/20211228/20211228-name.jpg)](url)

Hi folks! The team lended me the keys to the car this week, I'll try to return it fully tanked up and scratch-free. Anne and team each week do an amazing job on the newsletter. Over the last 18 months I've need to stay as exclusively focused on running Adafruit with the team/Ladyada during some of the toughest times for all of us - from COVID which is currently _not_ going away, to the chip / supply chain issues, it's been a ride. However, I wanted to say thank you to our community, customers, our team, and everyone who helps and supports us. Python on hardware, specifically CircuitPython, is something that is bigger than all of us now, or one company, and we'll continue to be open-source, community-driven, and helping everywhere we can together building something special.

[![title](../assets/20211228/20211228-name.jpg)](url)

For this week's newsletter I'm adding some of how we arrive at naming of products, some news, and some art. Maybe a few things we can all think about in 2022 and do together too.

[![title](../assets/20211228/20211228-name.jpg)](url)

One of the ideas for December (plans, ya know, we all have them until...) was to publish some of the behind the scenes at Adafruit, more, including some art, black and white photos, and things we're doing prove we're human-like sometimes. This newsletter is part of it, but if you want to see more, for this month (Dec 2021), [I'm posting art, behind the scenes, and more on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ptorrone) [@ptorrone](https://twitter.com/ptorrone) - and using Twitter how you're not supposed to at all - it's just images, no text, no replies, or likes, it's all black and white. If you're a long time reader, this is sorta like a tiny microblog version of Hackaday, which I started 17+ years ago, and it's now owned by someone else (I am reader and fan only now)... [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/) & [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackaday). So, we'll see what January brings and if folks want to keep this window open.

[![title](../assets/20211228/20211228-name.jpg)](url)

For the readers who have not been here from the start, we started the Python on Hardware newsletter November of 2016, as we built what's now CircuitPython, in the open. We wanted to tell the story of decisions we made, updates, progress, and more - we publish on GitHub, we use Wordpress and a separate non-Adafruit-commerce site (we do not spam, etc.), to get the newsletter out each week, we're up to about 9,239 readers (but who is counting?!), thank you!

[![title](../assets/20211228/20211228-name.jpg)](url)

As far as scheduling goes for weekly videos and more, the teams are taking the week off - so expect all your favorite videos, live and recorded, to return next week. Even our Ladyada is taking this week off for videos, well - besides the ones she's going to do no matter what with what she is working on from her desk and more :)

On with the newsletter!

## Happy 2022 from Adafruit 

[![Happy 2022 from Adafruit](../assets/20211228/Adafruit2022.png)](https://adafruit.com/)

Last Python on Hardware newsletter of the year! At the end of each year, or the beginning of the new year (depending how ya look at), we post up a call for input for what's next with CircuitPython, and reflect on what we were able to build together over the last year. Sooo! It's that time again, look for the post and socialz from Scott the lead on CircuitPython VERY SOON.

[![Bare metal Raspberry Pi CircuitPython](../assets/20211228/20211228hdmi.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/11/02/bare-metal-circuitpython-on-a-raspberry-pi-hdmi-and-e-ink/)

The CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi "bare metal" is what I'm looking forward to using more once we have it cooked, HDMI out specifically, and being able to make a stand-alone Python computer!

[![Bare metal Raspberry Pi CircuitPython](../assets/20211228/20211228hdmi-eink.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/11/09/tune-in-soon-scott-shawcroft-on-bare-metal-raspberry-pi-circuitpython-circuitpython-tomshardware-tannewt/)

For the beta, or maybe it's alpha... I tried out what we had and had the HDMI out go to an e-ink HDMI display for kicks, it was neat and I want more.

## New board SCORPIO

[![title](../assets/20211228/20211228-name.jpg)](url)

We have a new board coming out, and it's called SCORPIO. How do we come up with names of things? Well, all depends on what something is, if there are potential naming issues, and really a million things. For SCORPIO, here's how we got there ... I'd say the closest analogy for good naming, or really good ideas in general, is skateboarding. We're all doing tricks, building off each other, it's not a competition, but it's also not just standing around - we're pushing each other for the design of the thing, the naming of the thing, and it's an amplification of the best of each other, and imagining a future with this thing in it, and the potential good it can provide. PhilB on our team is fantastic at all sorts of things, you may remember him from such hits as "NeoPixels" and "keep Adafruit weird"... so we started tossing some naming ideas around...

The easy and obvious ones bubble to the top right away, the design has 8MB of QSPI flash, SO IT MUST BE OCTO RIGHT? No! We cannot fall in to the trap. Names we are not going with -  Colorswirl, Octo Detroit, Eight Ashbury, Kobold ... OctoStar came up from the community, we're not scared of showing works in progress, even down to the naming, we often get good ideas on what to consider, and we also get good ideas on what we're not going to do too. Kraken came up, but it's been co-opted in politics, at least for now, skipping that one. Otto (Italian). Nautilus. Cephalopi. 20,000 LEDs under the C. Hot dog buns come in packs of 8, if there’s a metaphor to be had there. 8-wind compass rose. 8th wonder. Octo Who or Octo Manhattan, nope. I tossed around pillow, but that's already used for lots of things, I did like the idea of this dreamy fluffy rainbow thing, but kept moving on. Other ones we tossed around: Scintillate (sparkly and has an “8” in it)
The Shining, Sea Star (8 arms), Tardigrade or water bear (8 legs), Hydra (multiple heads, bonus points for dragon), Peacock (for its colorful feathers). Lumin8 and Illumin8 are of course already in use by other companies.

Mentioning “8” specifically kind of paints into a corner, if some future variant had more or fewer outputs, then what.

Spiders, they have eight legs, they are arachnids, which include ... scorpions ! We're not stuck with 8, but it's nod 8 in a subtle way. 

> "In astrology, the eighth house is the house of the zodiac sign of Scorpio and planet Pluto. Scorpio (♏︎) is the eighth astrological sign in the zodiac, originating from the constellation of Scorpius, the eighth house is the house of the zodiac sign of Scorpio and planet Pluto. It is viewed as the house of sex, taboos, death, resurrection and other people's possessions. It spans 210°–240° ecliptic longitude. Under the tropical zodiac (most commonly used in Western astrology), the Sun transits this sign on average from October 23 to November 22. It is viewed as the house of sex, taboos, death, resurrection and other people's possessions." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpio_(astrology)).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were no new boards added, but some are in development!

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect for Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20211228/20211228bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20211228/20211228pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20211228/20211228pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20211228/20211228pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20211228/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **341**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I fixed a regression for 7.1.0 that caused `alarm.wake_alarm` to not be updated. This is the last bug we wanted to fix for 7.1.0. There are more 7.x.x bugs, but we will work on them for 7.2.0 or later.

As I write this, I am preparing the 7.1.0-rc.0 release. We would like to have 7.1.0 final available at the beginning of the new year.

I am also working on some infrastructure issues in library bundle building and in `circup`. Some have been fixed, and there are a few final ones to do.

**Jeff**

During the past week, I did some 'custodial' work, working with Dan to fix some problems that arose with the automatic builds of CircuitPython due to changes in libraries and packages we depend on.  I also worked on some personal projects, such as the birdbath that I talked about on last week's Show & Tell broadcast.

**Kattni**

Adafruit NeoSlider guide was published. Otherwise, it's been a short week, so not much else to report. Happy Holidays, everyone!

**Melissa**

This past week, I finished updating [Blinka Displayio](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_Displayio) to update the interface to CircuitPython 7. I also added typing information to everything to make it easier to know what kind of data is expected to be passed in. The plan is to do a little more restructuring so it's more in line with CircuitPython's layout and then let the community take it over if they want it to grow.

**Scott**

This week I got a bit distracted from Broadcom port work. Instead, I worked on adding sideset enable support for the RP2040's PIO. This is needed for the UART TX example and others as well. I'm using UART TX in my Sofle split keyboard that I showed off on the [Tom's Hardware Pi Cast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnxAq6czefY). This week and next are short weeks and I'll be wrapping up the Broadcom work while kicking off CircuitPython 2022 planning.

## Call for help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever!

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20211228/20211228weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages.

With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
