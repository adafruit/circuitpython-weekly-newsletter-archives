If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W Released!

[![Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W Release](../assets/20211102/20211102zero.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkp4THXHew)

Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W was announced and released (in limited quantities) by Raspberry Pi October 28th- [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-2/).

> Priced at $15, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W uses the same Broadcom BCM2710A1 SoC die as the launch version of Raspberry Pi 3, with Arm cores slightly down-clocked to 1GHz, bundled into a single space-saving package alongside 512MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM. The exact performance uplift over Zero varies across workloads, but for multi-threaded sysbench it is almost exactly five times faster.

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20211102/20211102bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20211102/20211102pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20211102/20211102pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20211102/20211102pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

This past week, I've studied a number of packages for doing cooperative multitasking in Python, including asyncio, Trio, and Curio. This is in preparation for choosing what we will do in CircuitPython. MicroPython has its own implementation of asyncio, written largely in Python. This should be straightforward to adapt to CircuitPython.

Asyncio does not yet include some features that would make using multitasking safer and less error-prone. Trio, especially, advocates for these features, which are called "structured concurrency". In structured concurrency, the lifetime of a set of tasks is typically limited to a block scope; error handling and task cancellation are also managed so as not to leave dangling tasks and still catch all task errors. In the long run, I would like add structured concurrency constructs to whatever API we provide.

I'm back to working on camera & image features. With the [work-in-progress `gifio` module](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/5490), it's possible to record animated gifs from a camera onto an SD card. The gif code originates from [OpenMV](https://docs.openmv.io/), another project that derives from MicroPython. I hope to find enough performance optimizations to capture 240x240 gifs at 10fps.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [VL53L1X Time of Flight sensor guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-vl53l1x). This guide has everything you need to get started using your [VL53L1X STEMMA QT sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3967) including an overview, pinouts, downloads resources, and examples in both CircuitPython and Arduino. If you picked up one of these handy little distance sensors, check out the guide.

I've also been working on updating the [Welcome to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython) guide. The update is still a work in progress, but there have already been some pretty significant changes to content and the guide structure. The goal is to create a smoother experience for folks who are new to CircuitPython, and I'm well on the way to having that completed. Some of the updates already available include a new [PyCharm and CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/pycharm-and-circuitpython) page and a number of pages now nested under [Advanced Setup](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/advanced-setup). Keep an eye on that guide to follow along, and an eye out here for when it's finished!

This week I've been working on updating the CircuitPython code editor so it is usable on mobile devices with smaller screens. This included building out the collapsible menu, making certain fonts smaller, and making the file dialog resize appropriately as well as a few bug fixes. I found a bug when trying to connect with mobile devices that crashed CircuitPython, so I wasn't able to test on an actual mobile device. So the focus has been more on the look screen size.

This has been a huge week for CircuitPython on the Raspberry Pi 4 (no other OS.) At the end of last week I got HDMI output working from displayio which means the terminal works. At the same time Thach got USB working! So you can get a REPL and see it on the screen with CircuitPython on the Raspberry Pi 4. 

The last few days have been spent trying to speed up CircuitPython. Fast, application processors like the one on the Pi 4 relies on caches to run fast without them they are limited by memory speed. Today I got the caches enabled in a way that speed everything up greatly but still works.

For good measure I also bumped up the compiler optimization level from -O2 to -O3 for more speed as well. I had tried earlier but it was crashing. I figured out the issue and now it's enabled.

Next up, I'll be diving into the EMMC controller that is used to manage the SD card and then connecting it to USB as a drive. That will give the full CIRCUITPY experience.
