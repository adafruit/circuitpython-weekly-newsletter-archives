## CircuitPython 6.2.0 Beta 3 Released!

[![CircuitPython 6](../assets/20210309/20210309cp6.jpeg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/03/03/circuitpython-6-2-0-beta-3-released/)

This release, 6.2.0-beta.3, is the fourth beta release of CircuitPython 6.2.0. It includes many fixes and enhancements. Across most ports it adds a second USB serial (CDC) channel, adds a `bitmaptool` module for help with `displayio`, and removes the limitation on `displayio.Group` size. The RP2040 port has many enhancements and fixes, and the Spresense port has several improvements as well. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this release!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210309/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **303**!

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

* Too many to list this week!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I was wrangling a bunch of PR's today (Wed, 3/3) and released CircuitPython 6.2.0-beta.3 this evening. This release has a ton of new features and fixes for the RP2040, a new `bitmaptool` module, a second CDC serial channel, and removes the limitation on `display.Group` size.

Before I did this release, I spent quite a while on getting `busio.I2C` to work better on the RP2040. Because of how the underlying hardware works, short I2C writes are bitbang'd instead of using the peripheral. Most I2C devices now work on the RP2040, and if yours doesn't, try `bitbangio.I2C` as a workaround.

I'll now switch to working on I2C on the ESP32-S2. There are some issues mixing WiFi and I2C after a soft reload, and the underlying problems need to be diagnosed and fixed.

**Jeff**

This week I published a guide on PIO with CircuitPython. There are 4 programs demoed, 3 with a standard LED and one to drive a Neopixel all with the rp2pio module that is available on the Raspberry Pi Pico as well as the Adafruit Feather RP2040.

**Kattni**

This week we applied the patch to the libraries to move running Pylint to the pre-commit, and took care of the issue that came out of the latest Pylint update with a now-working duplicate code check. There are still a few libraries that need to be updated, but we're working on it. Turns out some of our libraries could use a refactor, after all. Issues are being filed and we'll get to it when we can.

Otherwise, this week has been guide work, including the guide for the new [Feather RP2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4884). If you're lucky enough to get in on the first round of boards, I'll have a guide ready for you with detailed pinouts info, CircuitPython installation and getting started, and resource downloads.

**Lucian**

This past week I've mostly been working more on low power code, with some other miscellaneous tasks. I spent a bit of time yesterday working through the TouchIO module on the ESP32-S2, since the module had been added by a community member but never tested in full rigorous detail. There weren't any major bugs, but there were some sensitivity issues - the size and layout of a board can alter the capacitances that TouchIO uses to the point that they can cause inter-pin conflicts and excessive sensitivity if not tweaked. I'm looking into some ways we could try to safeguard against that board-by-board.

**Melissa**

This past week I have been working heavily with Linux Device Drivers. After updating the ST7789 Display Driver, this made things a bit easier, but there was still a conflict between the display driver and audio driver for the BrainCraft HAT. The display would either show noise on it or the audio would  stutter. When booting up, it seemed to be random which of the problems you got, but there was always at least one of the problems present.

I ended up getting our workaround of going back to the 5.4 kernel working again until the major problem can be resolved, but with only having a single display driver, the problem is simplified.

**Scott**

This week I've been heads down on making our flash chip support in CircuitPython more versatile. The RP2040 has a unique way of initializing flash that doesn't fit into our existing system. So, I've started factoring out our flash config into [a `nvm.toml` cascade tree](https://github.com/adafruit/nvm.toml), a human and machine readable "database" of config settings. [`cascadetoml`](https://github.com/adafruit/cascadetoml) is a tool to flatten the TOML tree in nvm.toml into one dictionary of flash settings. Once we have that, we can write a (hopefully) simple Python script to convert it into the form we need for the various ports. I'm starting with the RP2040 port since we *just* released the [Feather RP2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4884).

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/20210309/codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
