Python version 3.11 will have documententation which is theme responsive - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bulat_olga/status/1391287580965081088).

> "This is one of the reasons I love open source: When I see a problem, instead of simply complaining, I can open an issue or create a Pull Request to solve it. I only wish more government and educational sites were open source. Fun fact: I started making the PR for responsive theme because after birth of my baby I couldn't read as much at my computer, and had to read the phone instead."

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were no new boards added, but several are in development.

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210511/20210511bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/guides/latest)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the â€˜Download Project Bundleâ€™ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, youâ€™ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210511/20210511pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210511/20210511pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210511/20210511pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and youâ€™re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210511/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## Whatâ€™s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in!

**Dan**

Dynamic USB descriptors are almost done, and by the time you read this, will probably be showing up in the **main** build and in the 7.0.0 alpha release.

Because dynamic USB descriptors let you turn off both CIRCUITPY and the REPL, you can get into a state where your **boot.py** file locks you out of editing your code. So we're thinking that for each board, we will make a special CircuitPython build to recover. It will either erase **CIRCUITPY**, or simply go into safe mode without running **boot.py** or **code.py**, so that you can clean up your code or reformat the filesystem if it is damaged.

I continued working with Scott to bring in improvements from MicroPython by fixing tests that were broken in the updates. It's fun (for me anyway) to work deep in the core code that MicroPython and CircuitPython share.

I also integrated some work from community member Foamyguy to create simulated screenshots of the CIRCUITPY drive for the Learn system. It will save authors' time when creating guides, and also will always be kept up to date with the list of library names.  This is a great companion to the BundleFly service that sends all-in-one zip files for projects.

Over the last week, I've been in guide and template land. I published the ItsyBitsy RP2040 guide, and found some bugs in the CircuitPython board definition for it, which are now fixed. If you picked up an ItsyBitsy RP2040, make sure you're using the absolute newest version of CircuitPython for it to be able to utilise all the pins properly. Beyond that, I've been working on new template pages. All the Adafruit RP2040 board guides now have all of the existing templates in them, nested under a CircuitPython Essentials header. I have a long way to go to get all of the board guides updated, but it's a solid start.

This past week we merged in the nRF52 alarms and deep sleep port, and I've wrapped up the internal work for the RP2040. I've most recently been investigating issues with the reported restart reasons issued by Circuitpython - they should now correctly distinguish between the initial startup, a REPL-based reload, autoreloads caused by saving to a file, and supervisor reloads triggered from code. I'm also wading into the infrastructure of calling a different file than `code.py` after a reload - this will be useful for projects like games and animation, but will require some finagling with the new sleep code.

This past week I wrote up a fun project guide on using the PIR sensor on the FunHouse to control an electrical outlet so you can have devices likes fans and lights automatically turn on and off depending on whether you are moving around. You can check out the guide at https://learn.adafruit.com/motion-activated-outlet-with-the-adafruit-funhouse.

I also updated a guide that I had worked on last week for creating FunHouse projects with a temperature logger. The issue is that the temperature sensor is near the power circuitry and I go over some things you can do to mitigate the heating that can throw off the accuracy of the sensor. You can check out that new page at https://learn.adafruit.com/creating-funhouse-projects-with-circuitpython/temperature-logger-example.

**Scott**

I'm continuing the MicroPython merge. 1.12 is merged in and 1.13 is nearly there. Thanks to Jeff for helping fix the tough to debug test failures.

I've also been helping Trevor continue working on PyLeap, our first iOS app for working with BLE file transfer.
