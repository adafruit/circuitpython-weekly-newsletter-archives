## Adafruit Squeezes the Power of the RP2040 Into a USB key

[![Adafruit Trinkey RP2040 with QT connector](../assets/20210525/20210525toms.jpg)](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/adafruit-rp2040-trinkey-prototype)

On the [Desk of Ladyada](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjF7R1fz_OOXUtaFu7-_D1UCugC8OecKv), Limor discusses development of the Adafruit Trinkey RP2040 with QT connector - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIhUpL8eyQI).

> We've wanted to have something that plugs into a USB A port and provides a QT port for a while. But since we want it to support any and all QT boards, we need more RAM and storage than the SAMD21 can provide. We probably cannot buy any SAMD51's for like a year - but RP2040 is a good option! Lots of RAM and we stuck an 8MB flash on there. The idea is you can attach a QT sensor or whatever on top with some nylon standoffs, maybe it will even auto-detect which sensors are plugged in! We made the boot button a user-button too, thanks to a li'l diode friend.

Liz ([@BlitzCityDIY](https://twitter.com/BlitzCityDIY)) [submitted a PR](https://twitter.com/BlitzCityDIY/status/1396516841246298113) to add support for the [Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/first-pi-silicon-arduino-nano-rp2040-connect-spotted) to CircuitPython! So far so good, the digital pins all toggle right and see the built in LSM6DSOX chip on the I2C port. There is a driver for this IMU so the video has quick demo: an external OLED wired up on the same I2C bus, reading acceleration/gyro data and displaying it - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ppFYk1YdDjo)

> CircuitPython is my “go to” for teaching people how to program. I have had so many friends that want to learn how to program, and they always want to learn something “useful” like React first, because that’s what people are using at work. But, you have to crawl before you can walk, and the simplicity of a computer without an OS or complicated libraries is a great place to start. Make a light blink. If button is pressed, turn a light on. And before you know it, you can press buttons and have music play, or send a tweet to Twitter, etc... I like the [Circuit Playground (Express)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express) for getting started: It has a lot you can do without attaching external devices - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/05/21/circuitpython-the-go-to-for-teaching-people-how-to-program-circuitpython-hackernews/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27205907).

Ladyada respind the STEMMA Friend design from a SAMD21 to an RP2040 to take advantage of the more-powerful chip, to make it CircuitPython-friendlier and faster at doing stuff like I2C sniffing. While porting over the Arduino code (which pretty much works just fine, she noticed the display was a little sluggish due to SPI data being sent over one byte at a time with a delay. So she added a bulk-transfer SPI function to the Philhower RP2040 core to take advantage of the pico-sdk's buffered writes - it's now 10x faster! - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/5mzlP_6rZ7w).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were 2 new boards added!

- [Rock Pi 4C](https://circuitpython.org/blinka/rock_pi_4c/)
- [Rock Pi E](https://circuitpython.org/blinka/rock_pi_e/)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210525/20210525bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210525/20210525pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210525/20210525pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

We have seen some RP2040 boards not be able to start CircuitPython from a power-cycle. Scott and I brainstormed on this, looking at Saleae traces of communication with the flash chip. This problem appears to be due to the crystal oscillator taking longer to start than expected, and I have a fix for that.

MacOS on the M1 does not return information about USB devices in the same way that MacOS on older Macs does. This caused the Mu beta not to be able to detect CircuitPython boards on M1 Macs. Neradoc came up with a fix for this, and I tested it on an M1 Mac and submitted a change to Mu to incorporate the fix.

I just finished a guide about [Customized USB Devices in CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/customized-usb-devices-in-circuitpython), which documents how to use the dynamic USB descriptor capability I added recently.

**Kattni**

Last week I attended PyCon - talks will be available on YouTube soon, if they're not already. I also hosted CircuitPython Development Sprints. Things were entirely virtual this year which made my usual way of doing things a bit more difficult. A couple of folks who already hard CircuitPython-compatible hardware joined me and had a great time, so it in the end it was worth it. I enjoyed diving into code which I haven't had a chance to do in a long time.

Earlier last week, I started the guide for the NeoKey Trinkey (which should be published by now). Later in the week, I started the guide for the Rotary Trinkey as well.

I helped Dylan get an Adabot patch going to add a feature to library PRs wherein GitHub displays a message linking to the Pylint/Black guide if your PR fails Pylint or Black. As well, we're adding a template to PRs with links to that guide, and the CircuitPython Design Guide to hopefully help folks before they submit the PR.

**Lucian**

This past week I merged in a number of the new structural changes for Alarm that have been in the works for a while, as well as getting the new STM32 Alarm module added into main. As the work on sleep finally wraps up, I've been taking power profiles of the various ports using the Monsoon and Nordic PPK2 power monitors.

Measuring the low-power performance of chips on dev boards that aren't specifically specialized for long battery life is an imperfect process - there are many parasitic components on the average dev board that can draw current over time, and without specific power saving hardware in place, there's no way to prevent them from shortening a device's battery life even when the MCU core is totally turned off. But I was encouraged to find that even on baseline Feather boards, all ports can hit hundreds of hours of battery life for an average Lipo using Deep Sleep, and power-optimized boards with a couple of AAA batteries can extend over a year, which is desirable for projects like environmental sensors and other isolated data logging devices.

[![Lucian](../assets/20210525/20210525lucian.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I'm also reviewing and testing other upcoming power centric features, such as the changes to Status LED that Scott has been working on (which will reduce the draw from LED use after executing, while sleeping, and while using the REPL), and the upcoming Alarm module for the RP2040. 

**Melissa**

This past week, I finished up my Pet Water Bowl sensor guide for the FunHouse. This one was a little tricky because if there's constant current running through the board, the traces will start to oxidize which affects the readings. I got around this by using a GPIO pin on a second port on the FunHouse to send power to the Water Sensor and was able to control when it was on. You can [check out the guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/pet-bowl-water-level-sensing-with-the-funhouse-and-home-assistant).

I also wrote another guide. This one is about running Blinka and CircuitPython libraries over MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico. It goes over setting everything up using the Thonny editor. Due to the limited space, I cover how to copy everything manually, but am hoping to streamline the process even more. The guide ended up being more popular than I expected. You can [see the guide here](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-libraries-on-micropython-using-the-raspberry-pi-pico).

**Scott**

This last week I've been wrapping up the status LED changes. It's very close to done and I fixed safe mode on the RP2040 along the way. Next, I'm dusting off the cobwebs from my previous attempt at BLE workflow. Antonio did an awesome test app last week that works with the prototype implementation so I'm excited to hook it up to the real thing. The protocol is [documented here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE_File_Transfer).
