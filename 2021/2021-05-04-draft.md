Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! There is a lot of news to get to this week!

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). 

## Happy 8th Birthday MicroPython!

[![Happy 8th Birthday MicroPython!](../assets/20210504/20210504micropython.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/04/29/happy-8th-birthday-micropython-micropython-micropython-and-adafruit-sponsoring-join-in/)

MicroPython turned 8 years old on April 29th. That day in 2013 was when Damien wrote the first line of code (in private, before anyone knew about it, before it was even called MicroPython). Now MicroPython is used on many different types of microcontrollers and single board computers (SBC) in both educational and commercial platforms. [Version 1.15](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.15) was just released two weeks ago with some great new features.

[![Adafruit sponsors MicroPython on GitHub](../assets/20210504/20210504github.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/04/29/happy-8th-birthday-micropython-micropython-micropython-and-adafruit-sponsoring-join-in/)

Adafruit has stocked the [official MicroPython PyBoards](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=pyboard&sort=BestMatch) from Damien for a while. They have also made direct donations to MicroPython to support Damien’s work, as well as make and share contributions based on the CircuitPython core on MicroPython. Now, with GitHub sponsors, Adafruit just provided a $5k sponsorship. The MicroPython goal is $5k a month in sponsors, so 1 full month is on Adafruit. If you use MicroPython, [please consider sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/micropython) a monthly or one-time gift as well. Companies / orgs can now sponsor, so this was Adafruit sponsoring.

## The Python Software Foundation Welcomes Microsoft as a Visionary Sponsor

[![Microsoft a PSF Visionary Sponsor](../assets/20210504/20210504psfms.jpg)](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/04/welcoming-microsoft-as-visionary-sponsor.html)

Microsoft has been a long-time supporter of the Python Software Foundation, starting in 2006. Today, Microsoft employs several core developers working part-time on CPython and the Python Steering Council, making significant contributions as PEP authors. Python creator Guido van Rossum has recently joined Microsoft as a Distinguished Engineer and is exploring performance improvements to CPython.

Aside from helping advance the Python tooling and ecosystem, Microsoft has shown strong involvement with the Python community and has been a long-time sponsor of PyCon US, including four years at the top tier Keystone level. Microsoft’s support for the community extends to sponsorships of regional and international Python events including in emerging regions.

This year, Microsoft is increasing their contributions to the PSF even further as a Visionary Sponsor. Microsoft’s sponsorship funds will be used to support the PSF with a focus on working with the Packaging Working Group on improving PyPI and the packaging ecosystem  - [PSF Blog](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/04/welcoming-microsoft-as-visionary-sponsor.html) and the [Microsoft Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/supporting-the-python-community/).

> "...when I actually finally put together this little circuit and put some data into memory that should show up as color and it showed up color, it was just one of those eureka moments and you're just shaking inside. It was just unbelievable. Here we had it in just a couple of chips. I had color, and then I had graphics, and then I had hi-res, and then I had paddles and sound to put games into the machine." - [Steve Wozniak](http://www.foundersatwork.com/steve-wozniak.html).

[![RP2040 Camera Image Capture in CircuitPython](../assets/20210504/20210504camera.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_OV7670)

Did you know the RP2040 PIO periperals can be configured for reading in camera/video data? That's right, you can directly wire up OV7670/OV2640-like cameras to a RP2040/Pico and then read out image data into a RAM buffer (thankfully theres a ton of RAM on the RP2040). Adafruit has just placed support into CircuitPython as well, so one can read a buffer and then pipe it back out over SPI to a TFT LCD display. This could be great for image recognition, tinyML, DIY cameras, IoT monitoring, etc! - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_OV7670) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbSXNZSdJj0).

## The New CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![CircuitPython Project BundleFly](../assets/20210504/20210504bundlefly.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/04/14/adafruitlearningsystem-weekly-update-project-bundle/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any CircuitPython guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210504/20210504pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210504/20210504pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210504/20210504pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

See the introductory video by Ladyada - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgekT8epJjo).

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210504/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm finishing up implementing dynamic USB descriptors. I am already generating the dynamic descriptors, and have CIRCUITPY, the REPL, and HID devices working. There are some tricky issues related storage management: the dynamic descriptors must be carried over from boot.py, after its virtual machine has finished running and the heap has been discarded. Because the descriptors are dynamic, their size is not known, and ideally I only want to use as much RAM as is necessary. So I'm using a few tricks to minimize RAM use, such as saving a buffer on the stack temporarily between VM runs.

**Jeff**

I've been helping Scott out with the merge of MicroPython 1.12 into CircuitPython. MicroPython and CircuitPython share a great set of tests of all the core language functionality, which have caught problems accidentally introduced during the merge process.  I'll continue to help Scott as needed while there are more versions of MicroPython to merge and more tests to fix.

I also published my first CircuitPython library, adafruit_ov7670. Together with the imagecapture module in the development version of CircuitPython, this can be used to capture images from an OV7670 camera (on Grand Central M4 and RP2040-based boards) and display the data on a displayio LCD.

**Kattni**

This week I published my final newsletter: welcome back Anne edition! Thanks to everyone for sticking through it with me. Anne will be getting back to it now.

Otherwise, my week contained a lot of miscellaneous. I reviewed a significant number of PRs with documentation updates. Thanks to Jose David M. for all of the improvements! Continued work on templates, including adding some new ones and organising the templates better on the backend (thanks to Sheehan for manually doing that for me). I added a few pages to the FunHouse guide. And finally, I started the ItsyBitsy RP2040 guide, which will be out soon, so keep an eye out for that if you're interested. 

**Lucian**

This past week I've been wrapping up alarms and sleep on the RP2040, and working on merging in the NRF52, STM32, and ESP32-S2 updates to the alarm module. Mostly a lot of formatting and testing related busywork. My hope this week is to compare the power profiles of the Feathers for each of the 4 MCU types that support Alarm (ESP32-S2, nRF52840, STM32F405, and RP2040), so CircuitPython users have a reference for how much power they use during light and deep sleep across different ports.

**Melissa**

This past week, I wrote a new guide on creating FunHouse projects. Like some similar guides I've written in the past, this guide covered the FunHouse specifics to look out for as well as going over the code examples included in the library. You can check out the guide [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/creating-funhouse-projects-with-circuitpython).

I also had a guide on using the FunHouse with Home Assistant that I had written a couple weeks ago get published. There was a little delay in the guide because it was waiting for some content in another guide that I had published earlier. You can check out that guide [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-the-adafruit-funhouse-with-home-assistant).

**Scott**

This week I've been continuing the MicroPython merge. 1.11 is merged into main and 1.12 is nearly ready for review. I hope to get a good way through 1.13 by the end of this week. Hopefully, 1.14 and 1.15 will be easier too.
