> We saw this nifty chip on the [nicechips sub-reddit](https://reddit.com/r/nicechips/comments/gzbsqn/aw9523_16_channel_i2c_io_expander_and_led_driver/) a few months ago and got a few samples. Recently we were thinking how we could really use this chip in a more complex design that could use a GPIO expander. So...it's time to make a STEMMA breakout! This I2C expander driver has 16 constant-current LED drivers and I/O pins. It seems pretty straightforward, just watch out for the address line 'default pin values' and the reset pin's internal pulldown. This breakout is looooooong so that you get every IO pin plus a matching ground pad.

> We've been putting off getting a Feather board designed using the ESP32-S2... The ESP32-S2 mini modules make an easy job of this board, it's very compact and the pins lined up perfectly (don't you love when that happens) so that the IO numbers match the Feather pinout we prefer. We even got the high speed SPI pins on the SPI port, and the two DAC pins on A0 and A1. Given that we don't need a USB to serial converter, and flash memory is built into the 'mini, we had lots of space left in the middle. We ended up deciding on putting in a LC709203 battery monitor and a BMx280 sensor footprint that can place DPS310, BMP280 or BME280. For adding other sensors we have a vertical-style STEMMA QT in the center. The current mini modules have 4Mbyte flash and no PSRAM, but given the existence of ESP32-S2FN4R2, we hope it'll eventually happen.

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210105/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

The last two weeks have been fairly short for me due to schedule changes and the holidays. With that in mind, I've been largely focused on getting existing projects out the door as well as documentation and guide work. While it's already into January, as I write this it's the first work day of 2021 so I thought to reflect on the past year. It's ended up being overlong for this format, and I think it's important enough that I've split it off into a [blog post](https://blog.adafruit.com/). As I think the message is an important and with any luck hopeful one. 

Thanks all for being a part of my community and everything you've done to help in 2020.

**Dan**

I prepared and released CircuitPython 6.0.1. It fixed a significant BLE and FrequencyIO regressions. We also included Scott's JSON speedup, which is substantial.

Since then I've been working on fixes clearing the issue queue for 6.1.0. There are still a number of issues that need fixing or research.

**Jeff**

This week I released the next beta test version of CircuitPython, 6.1.0-beta.3.  Thanks to contributions from Adafruit people and the community, we continue to move ESP32-S2 towards a stable release!  Check it out and give us feedback.

This week was a short week for me. I worked with Bryan on the [new guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ltr390-uv-sensor for the [Adafruit LTR390](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4831), and created the fritzing object for the board. I wrote the [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-gator) for the new [MPR121 QT Gator breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4830). I also did some miscellaneous support on Discord and the forums.

**Lucian**

This past week I've been working on a new MagTag guide for smart flashcards, and reviewing further changes to the Socket module.

**Melissa**

This past week I took some time off and have been enjoying the holidays.

**Scott**

The big thing this week was getting the PinAlarm code merged in. PinAlarm allows you to wake from sleep (light or deep) based on the logic level of an external pin. This is commonly used to wake based on button presses or based on the interrupt line from an external sensor. Keep trying the latest versions of CircuitPython for the latest and greatest.
