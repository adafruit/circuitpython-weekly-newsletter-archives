## Adafruit IO Wippersnapper - We're looking for beta testers!

[![Wippersnapper](../assets/20210720/20210720wippersnapper.jpg)](url)

Adafruit is starting to expand the beta program for Adafruit.io WipperSnapper. If you don't know already - Adafruit.io WipperSnapper is a no-code IoT interface for Adafruit.IO – it lets you turn any WiFi-capable board into an IoT device without any programming. Simply select what devices are connected to which pins on the hardware and it will auto-configure the firmware and even create an IO feed for visualization. The service is 100% free, all you need is an Adafruit.com account.

For information about how to get invited, see the post on the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/07/12/adafruit-io-wippersnapper-update-support-for-more-esp32-s2-development-boards-and-beta-information-iot-adafruit-adafruitio/).

## Hack Chat with Adafruit's Ladyada July 21st

[![Chat with Adafruit's Ladyada](../assets/20210720/20210720chat.jpg)](https://hackaday.io/event/180454-python-your-keyboard-hack-chat-with-adafruit)

The Adafruit crew will host the Hack Chat on Wednesday, July 21 at noon Pacific / 3pm EDT.

Especially over the last year and a half, most of us have gotten the feeling that there's little distinction between our computers and ourselves. We seem welded together, inseparable even, attached as we are day and night to our machines as work life and home life blend into one gray, featureless landscape where time passes unmarked except by the accumulation of food wrappers and drink cans around our work areas. Or maybe it just seems that way.

Regardless, there actually is a fine line between machine and operator, and in most instances it's that electromechanical accessory that we all love to hate: the keyboard. If you buy off the shelf, it's never quite right -- too clicky, not clicky enough, wrong spacing, bad ergonomics, or just plain ugly design. The only real way around these limitations is to join the DIY keyboard crowd and roll your own, specifically customized to your fingers and your needs -- at least until you realize that it's not quite perfect, and need to modify it again.

Hitting this moving target is often as much a software problem as it is a hardware issue, but as is increasingly the case these days, Python is ready to help. To go into depth on how Python can be leveraged for the custom keyboard builder, our good friends at Adafruit, including Limor "Ladyada" Fried, Phillip Torrone, Dan Halbert,  Kattni Rembor, and Scott Shawcroft will stop by the Hack Chat. We suspect they'll have some cool stuff to show off, in addition to sharing their tips and tricks for making DIY keyboards just right. If you're building custom keebs, or even if you're just "keyboard curious", you won't want to miss this one - [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/event/180454-python-your-keyboard-hack-chat-with-adafruit) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/RJbERjszeu8).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added, but several are in development.

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210720/20210720bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210720/20210720pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210720/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Jeff**

I finished my calculator guide and it's (now published on the Learn system)[https://learn.adafruit.com/desk-calculator-with-circuitpython]—Check it out if building & 3d printing a custom 20-key calculator appeals to you.

I also did some blogging about USB HID descriptors, including how to enable CircuitPython's keyboard to have full "N-Key Rollover", rather than being limited to 6 keys plus modifiers: [Part 1](https://emergent.unpythonic.net/01625944378) and [Part 2](https://emergent.unpythonic.net/01626210345)

Finally, it's entirely behind the scenes but we've merged two sets of improvements I made to free up precious flash storage space so we can squeeze a few more features into CircuitPython 7.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [MacroPad CircuitPython library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MacroPad). It takes all the features of the MacroPad, wraps in HID and MIDI, and puts them all together in an easy-to-use library. Beyond the basic features, such as reading key presses and the rotary encoder, the library includes the ability to rotate the MacroPad without having to remap the keys and pixels yourself, as well as being able to easily display lines of text or a bitmap image. For more details, check out [the documentation](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/macropad/en/latest/).

Since that point, I've been bug fixing as folks get into testing it and find issues. Next up is a couple of product guides and a potential MacroPad project!

**Melissa**

This past week, I finished up working on a Cat Detector guide. In order to make it more than a big bundle of wires, I designed a single piece 3D-Printable stand for it which turned out great. The Cat Detector uses Machine Learning and Microsoft Lobe to detect cats. You can check out the [learn guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/naughty-cat-detector-using-microsoft-lobe). 

**Scott**

I've wrapped up the Micro:Bit v2 work and BLE workflow work for now. code.circuitpython.org is ugly but functional. I'll be working with other Adafruit folks to make it prettier and more functional. In the meantime, I'll be squashing some bugs to get us closer to releasing 7.0.0 stable.
