On July 8th, the Talk Python Live Stream host Michael Kennedy had guests Scott Shawcroft and Damien George to discuss how MicroPython and CircuitPython are working together to further embed Python onto all the small things - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/07/08/circuitpython-and-micropython-talk-python-live-stream-live-now-talkpython/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKBmeFb7zHY).

## CircuitPython 7.0.0 Alpha 4 Released

[![CircuitPython 7 beta](../assets/20210713/20210713cp7.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/07/08/circuitpython-7-0-0-alpha-4-released/)

CircuitPython 7.0.0-alpha.4, has been released. It is relatively stable, but contains a number of issues still to be addressed for 7.0.0. The Python API’s it presents may change.

Notable additions to 7.0.0 since 6.3.0 include:

* Support for the CircuitPython development workflow over BLE.
* Camera support on ESP32S2.
* The keypad key-scanning module.
* Run-time customization of USB devices.
* Merging in of MicroPython fixes and enhancements as of MicroPython 1.16.
* Simplifications to the RGB status LED codes.
* A clocking fix for a few samples of RP2040 boards.

## Mu 1.1.0-beta 5 is now out

[![Mu 1.1.0-beta 5](../assets/20210713/20210713mu.jpg)](https://madewith.mu/mu/users/2021/07/05/beta5.html)

Mu 1.1.0 Beta 5 is now available on their [downloads page](https://codewith.mu/en/download). It is a beta release so it may contain bugs or unfinished features. Bug reports or feedback via GitHub is solicited. The Mu Team had hoped for a regular (fortnightly) release tempo. Due to the voluntary nature of Mu’s development and because some of the updates in this release were quite challenging, this release is a LOT later than the developers had planned - [Mu Blog](https://madewith.mu/mu/users/2021/07/05/beta5.html).

## Newsletter Statistics

[![Newsletter Stats Developed](../assets/20210713/20210713stats.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YXpXSfQkvuk)

Seeing that some email newsletters are providing numbers as to their subscription and effectiveness rates, Adafruit presents the same for the Python on Microcontrollers newsletter.

Growth is steady but has been a bit less this past quarter. The latest quarter saw a significant increase in user interaction. Also the percentage of links clicked has risen fairly steadily over the entire period.

The demographics information on Mailchimp states there is a greater than 65% male subscriber rate.

This information will be used by Adafruit to help grow the subscriber base, especially in areas which may be underserved.

We are looking at providing quarterly updates on these numbers - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/07/12/statistics-on-the-python-on-microcontrollers-newsletter-for-2020-2021-adafruit/).

## "Adafruit” made with VQ-GAN + CLIP

[!["Adafruit” made with VQ-GAN + CLIP](../assets/20210713/20210713ai.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/07/12/adafruit-made-with-vq-gan-clip/)

Over the weekend, Adafruit made some generative AI art using VQ-GAN + CLIP tutorial and Google Collab Notebook. It’s a bunch of Python that can take words and make pictures based on trained data sets.

This one is the word “Adafruit”, so above is what the output is based on the training. 

It starts out as a little LED looking thing, and eventually evolves to some goth looking cosplay thing and then pink hair grows out of it. It’s on a table with some tools, parts, and some fruit. Not bad, if this was shown to someone in the electronics world and asked what company is this, they’d probably say Adafruit - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/07/12/adafruit-made-with-vq-gan-clip/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added but several are in development.

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210713/20210713bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210713/20210713pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210713/20210713pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210713/20210713pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210713/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

I released CircuitPython 7.0.0-alpha.4 on Thursday, July 8. There are still plenty of further improvements and fixes in the pipeline.

I've fixed some issues with audio and displays on the RP2040, but there is further work to do. There are some mysterious unwanted interactions between different uses of DMA. A DMA transaction that is seemingly finished can affect a following one adversely. I'm debugging this and learning more about the RP2040 in the process.

This week I've been splitting my time between some low level core changes and a keypad project for the Adafruit Learning System..

The core changes will help us squeeze features we want in version 7 into the smallest boards like the Trinkeys. This has reached the pull request stage.

The keypad project is a calculator with 20 MX-style keys on a custom PCB & 3D printed enclosure, running CircuitPython. At the time of writing, I'm working on finishing up the guide.

Last week was a short week for me. I started the MacroPad library and published the MacroPad guide. The guide has everything you need to get started with your new MacroPad, including detailed pinouts info, CircuitPython and Arduino examples, and downloads resources. The upcoming library will make using the features on your MacroPad with CircuitPython super simple. Keep an eye out for it to make your CircuitPython MacroPad projects even better!

I'm also working on getting `_pixelbuf` and `adafruit_pypixelbuf` in line to be drop in replacements for each other, and moving the `colorwheel()` function to its own native module in CircuitPython to make it even simpler to use. This will make `colorwheel()` available on most CircuitPython-compatible boards without needing to import it from Pixelbuf.

This past week was a shorter week for me. I worked on adding some stability improvements to the WebSerial ESPTool, but ran into some complications and have put that on hold for the moment. I picked up working on a new guide using machine learning to detect cats on counters. I'll provide more details and a link to a guide soon.

**Scott**

I took a couple days off so I’ll be getting caught up and then picking up the [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org) work to add serial support as well. Then I should have all the pieces for testing and we can then rearrange everything to work better together. Thursday I recorded a Talk Python to Me podcast where Damien is a guest too. YouTube link for the stream is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKBmeFb7zHY).
