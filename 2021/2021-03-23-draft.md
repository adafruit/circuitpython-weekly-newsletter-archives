If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

My ESP32-S2 fix for a bad interaction of I2C with wifi went into CircuitPython last week. It's still not clear exactly why the fix works. Unfortunately the part of the ESP-IDF SDK that I would need to trace is in closed-source code, though much of the ESP-IDF is open source.

As I mentioned last week, we turned off the second CDC serial channel in CircuitPython by default due to its interference with some workflows. It is still available in a custom build. To ameliorate the problem in the future, I have written a small library, [Adafruit_Board_Toolkit](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Board_Toolkit), that determines which of the two serial channels is the REPL channel. I've submitted a [pull request to Mu](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/pull/1371) to incorporate some code that uses the library. Using the library also means that we can identify CircuitPython boards without needing to know their USB Vendor and Product IDs (VID/PIDs). To make the library work, I had to enhance some Windows-specific code from the pyserial library that returns information about serial ports  Windows. Our community member Neradoc also fixed an issue with similar code for MacOS. Together, we have submitted two [pull](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial/pull/566) [requests](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial/pull/571) to the pyserial library. The fixed code lives in the Adafruit_Board_Toolkit library for now.

**Jeff**

Among other things, I've been working on some speed boosts for bitmaps with CircuitPython: In the recently-released beta (together with an updated bundle) it is now possible to read pcf-format fonts much faster, up to 10x faster for really chonky font files, thanks to `bitmaptools.readinto`. Need to get data between a bitmap and some other form?  `bitmaptools.arrayblit` can cover your needs going IN to a bitmap, and soon you'll be able to use a bitmap with `memoryview` or `ulab.frombuffer` to get your data back out quick.

I think this will enable some cool stuff, and I can't wait to see what the community finds to do with it.

**Kattni**

This week I finished up some guide work. I am still working on getting pages set up using the new template feature in Learn, and getting those templates added to existing board guides. The idea is that instead of a general set of CircuitPython Essentials pages mirrored into every board guide, each guide will have its own tailored version that covers the same concept as every other board guide, except has specific code and wiring diagrams applicable to that board. It's going to take a lot of time, but it should make for a smoother experience for those getting started with CircuitPython and compatible boards. 

I also added a fancy wiring diagram to the Feather RP2040 guide, courtesy of Bill Binko from ATMakers. The Pinouts page was already quite thorough, but having a visual can be crucial for some folks, so this was an excellent addition.

Finally, we're still working through some CI issues across the libraries with regards to the recently enabled duplicate code check. Expect another Adabot patch soon to increase the threshold that triggers that check. Luckily, we've made it so CI changes do not require a release, so hopefully we don't destroy anyone's inbox too badly.

I'm finally honing in on some of the problems that have been affecting STM32 Deep Sleep mode, by using a Saleae logic analyzer to more accurately visualize when interrupts are occurring across the system:

[![Lucian](../assets/20210323/20210323lucian.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Currently, while the system can enter sleep correctly, it is having difficulty performing basic system tasks after waking up - I suspect that this is due to the way the RTC retains data across resets and low power modes, and I've been digging into the documentation to try and find reasons why it might ignore the hard reset that is supposed to occur on chip startup. I'm also seeing various other unexpected waking events and inefficiencies that might not be STM32 specific, and thus affecting every port to varying degrees of seriousness. Unfortunately, it's not easy to visualize when *every* interrupt in the system triggers, as convenient as that might be.

In other news, I've dug out my Meowbit to test out the PWMAudioIO module, which should allow WAV files to be played on boards that support it. I'm also keeping an eye on any additional socket issues that might need more attention going forward.

**Melissa**

This week I finished writing the 2.13" eInk display guide. This included writing drivers for the new higher resolution Tri-Color e-Ink displays for both CircuitPython and Raspberry Pi. You can check out the new guide [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-13-eink-display-breakouts-and-featherwings).

After that, I worked on fixing up miscellaneous GitHub issues and testing Pull Requests. This included work on improving the RPLidar library in an attempt to update it to a firmware that is only available on newer devices. Since mine is stuck on older firmware, it has been a lot of guesswork, reading documentation, and mostly just making sure it still works with the existing firmware.

**Scott**

I'm nearly through my flash adventures. I've debugged getting quad spi going and am now connecting it to the CircuitPython build. I also tweaked some of the settings in the nvm.toml repository that stores data about different flash chips: https://github.com/adafruit/nvm.toml

The last piece is to read the capacity of the flash from the chip itself so we can support many different sizes. Unfortunately, the init code is out of space. So, either with help we'll figure out how to compact the code or we'll add code to CircuitPython to load it later. Hopefully it'll be out for review next week and I can move onto BLE workflow.
