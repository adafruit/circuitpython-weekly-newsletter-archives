## Raspberry Pi Rolls Out New Documentation Online

[![Raspberry Pi Documentation](../assets/20210810/20210810doc.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/bring-on-the-documentation/)

Until recently, documentation for the non-Pico Raspberry Pi boards was on GitHub in GitHub Markdown language. As of Monday August 9th, a [new documentation site](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/) has been built and deployed directly from a [documentation repository](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation) using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), when someone pushes to the **master** branch. However people will mostly be working on the **develop** branch in the repository, which is the default branch when you take a fresh checkout, and also the branch you should target for your [pull requests](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/pulls) - [Raspberry Pi Blog](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/bring-on-the-documentation/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added, but there are some being worked on.

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210810/20210810bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210810/20210810pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210810/20210810pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210810/20210810pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210810/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I've fixed some more audio bugs, and am now working on a "crackling"-sound bug that is intermittent.

We are gradually knocking off the remaining issues for 7.0.0. A number remain (and we still are getting new ones), but we are making progress!

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20210810/20210810kattni.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Continuing with the camera theme, I've created a pull request to add QR code reading to all CircuitPython boards where we have camera support. This builds on a library called quirc by Daniel Beer (@dlbeer on github) that is also used by OpenMV. With the OV2640 camera, it takes the ESP32-S2 about a second to decode a simple QR code which can contain text, a URL, or other information. Scanning from an LCD computer monitor or a piece of paper works best, I haven't had much luck scanning from my phone's OLED screen.

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on a guide for using the MacroPad with Home Assistant via Remote Procedure Calls. This way a script running on the computer can make the actual networking calls and send the responses back over a serial connection. I was out sick for part of the week and was unable to finish the guide, so it should be coming soon.

**Kattni**

This week I spent quite a bit of time doing some cleanup around the templates, including moving code around, updating templates to use embedded examples, and using dynamically generated images to show what the CIRCUITPY drive should look like for some of the examples. I'm happy with where things are at the moment, so when I have time, I can move on to creating new templates and adding current templates to more guides.

I also updated the PCF8523 and DS3231 guides to include the STEMMA QT versions of the boards. We added those two RTC breakouts to the shop as new products (versus replacing the original version), so the guides reflect both options still being available.

**Scott**

This week has been another one full of bug hunting. The biggest bug I found was that the nRF UF2 bootloader wasn't copying UF2s >1MB over correctly. This lead to a number of issues we were seeing when trying to run debug nrf builds by loading with the UF2 bootloader. This issue has been fixed in [0.6.1 of the bootloader](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/releases/tag/0.6.1).

I also fixed a small issue with the BLE serial output and added the ability to disable the BLE workflow from boot.py.

I'm dabbling in a number of things at the moment as folks working on the BLE workflow apps make progress and inevitably find issues.

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/20210810/codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
