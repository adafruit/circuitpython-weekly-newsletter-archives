## Blinka in spppaaaaccce! Welcome Pythonauts!

Here are 50+ micro satellites loaded with CircuitPython for a hackathon! Imagine all the cool SCIENCE students can conduct in orbit if the software barrier is lowered by using python - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maholli404/status/1105895556180660224). KickSat Sprite, 2019, running Circuitpython - [GitHub](https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab/sprite).

We contacted Max to find out a bit more about this project, here are some the details - it's out of this world!

*I’m a materials science PhD student at Stanford working to make space more accessible. Did you know 65% of small satellite missions are [unsuccessful](https://sites.google.com/a/slu.edu/swartwout/home/cubesat-database/repeat-success)? This directly hinders the amount of science being conducted-- imagine if the first step to conducting a chemistry experiment required designing and building the fume hood or hotplate! That would be silly!*

*Small satellites have steep hardware and software learning curves. I’ll be speaking at [SmallSat 2019](https://smallsat.org/) about Prof. Zac Manchester and I’s low cost, open source, radiation-tolerant hardware designs implemented on KickSat-2, [currently in orbit](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/2374.html). Now I’m addressing the software side of things with CircuitPython.*

[![kicksat]({{ "/assets/31919kicsat.gif" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/2374.html)

*KickSat-2 deployment of “sprites.”*
 
*CircuitPython provides an approachable and logical means of conducting science with hardware. Paired with low-cost hardware shown to work in space, we can enable an new generation to question and explore the unknown. With the necessary “satellite stuff” already baked in, students can spend their time trying something new rather than reinventing the wheel (similar philosophy to early Arduino efforts and the microcontroller movement in general).*

*Empowered from the helpful discord community, I started off with CP with makerspace workshops like the snowflake.*

[![sam32]({{ "/assets/31919sam32.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://twitter.com/maholli404/status/1102382633365852160)

*Then my “SAM32” dev board, that’s potentially being integrated into the Stanford EE curriculum this fall. And now the workshop in New Zealand with the [Breakthrough Initiatives](https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/) folks.*

[![breakthrough]({{ "/assets/31919break.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/)

*This is all possible because of ADAFRUIT and the hard work/money you’ve invested in open source. THANK YOU. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do on my end to help the cause. I’d love to collaborate!*

## Python on hardware takes the stage in Singapore FOSSASIA

[![FOSSASIA]({{ "/assets/31919fossasia01.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/12/fossasia-summit-2019-embedded-programming-for-everyone-using-micropython-and-circuitpython-fossasiasg-iayanpahwa/)

Looks like [Ayan Pahwa's](https://twitter.com/iAyanPahwa) [talk at FOSSASIA Summit 2019](https://2019.fossasia.org/event/schedule.html#5001) in Singaport was a success! Thank you Ayan for being a mentor and sharing Python on hardware!

> _Embedded system or firmware programming can be very intimidating for beginners and often they tend to drop it very soon, thanks to connecting wires across a breadboard and writing bits and bytes to processor registers using bit shifting and logical operations.  Enter MicroPython and CircuitPython which let’s you program microcontrollers using everyone’s favourite Python programming language, no toolchain, cross compiler, assembler required. The code lives on your board itself and every lower level detail is abstracted. And if you think you can just blink LEDs with it, you just imagined tip of the iceberg. You can actually track the current location of International Space station and turn on an alarm when it is passing above you. Quite Interesting hah, There is so much we can do with it and it’s not scary.  Talk included Introduction and some example project showcase and can also include basic hands-on experience._

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy.

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## Digi-Key + Adafruit @ PyCon!

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/31919pycon.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

PyCon 2019 returns May 1–9, 2019 to Cleveland, OH – with talks, tutorials, sprints, and more! 

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/31919pyconDigi-Key.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

Big news! Digi-Key and Adafruit have teamed up for PyCon 2019 so every attendee (about 4,000!) will receive a [SPECIAL EDITION Circuit Playground Express](https://youtu.be/ZMx6qB-7z9U), running … CircuitPython.

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/31919pyconboards.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

This effort is to get Python on hardware to the most folks out there, at the events that bring people together.

This is just one of many efforts we’re teaming up with Digi-Key to continue to fuel all the developers from beginners to pro, using Python on microcontrollers.

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/31919team.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!

The PyCon 2019 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.

We will have a lot more updates, stay tuned to the [Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit), [Discord](http://adafru.it/discord), and more!

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/319199hello.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
