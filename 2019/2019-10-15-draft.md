## Scanning and advertising - BLE with CircuitPython update

[![Scan BLE](../assets/10152019/101519blecpx.jpg)](https://youtu.be/iHfd31qDTmw)

Scanning and advertising - BLE with CircuitPython update! Proximity based color demo using four Circuit Playground Express Bluefruits, [Tweets](https://twitter.com/tannewt/status/1182103930097958912) [and](https://twitter.com/tannewt/status/1182806194378833920) [YouTube](https://youtu.be/iHfd31qDTmw). Here's a bit more about it from Scott...

>_"Last week I was heads down on BLE scanning and advertising. It's the first phase of BLE and is incredibly powerful on it's own. By advertising data directly, one can control a bunch of other devices all at once. I showed a simple demo of one device changing the color of another and then a more complex demo where multiple devices are advertising and multiple are scanning. By moving the scanning devices closer to different advertisers, the color changes to the nearest._
>
> _To support this I've swapped the scan result from a list to an iterator, added rssi filtering and added advertising structure prefix filtering. These early filters reduce the number of Python level memory allocations and simplify the user code._
>
> _On the library side, I've modeled the BLE API after the CircuitPython Register library which uses Python's descriptor protocol to make defining advertisements declarative with easy to reuse components. This week I'm moving onto advertising designed to facilitate connections and ensuring all of the existing demos Dan has done still work."_

**Supercharge Your Hardware (Old and New) with CircuitPython - Scott Shawcroft**

>_"CircuitPython makes programming hardware easier than ever by bringing the popular Python language to modern, inexpensive 32-bit microcontrollers. This doesn’t need to be limited to modern hardware though. By pairing a modern microcontroller running CircuitPython and a vintage computer, such as a GameBoy or Yamaha piano keyboard, you can unlock the unique characteristics of these vintage devices. In this talk, you’ll learn the basics of how CircuitPython makes coding easy, how it works under the hood, and how to extend CircuitPython with C. As an example, we’ll supercharge a Nintendo’s GameBoy with CircuitPython. By the end of the talk, you’ll be able to supercharge your own hardware project with CircuitPython."_

Adafruit will have some team members at Supercon and some special hardware surprises thanks to Digi-Key!

## CircuitPython-compatible StringCar M0 Express and StringCar M4 Express boards

[![StringCar](../assets/10152019/101519stringcar01.png)](https://learn.adafruit.com/users/HarpDude)

[![StringCar](../assets/10152019/101519stringcar02.png)](https://learn.adafruit.com/users/HarpDude)

From [CGrover](https://learn.adafruit.com/users/HarpDude), a CircuitPython-compatible StringCar update!

>_"Here is the updated M0 version that's currently in process at OSH Park + OSH Stencils, and an M4 version that will be sent to the OSHs next week. The objective is to create a string car racer that can autonomously learn about its environment and adjust tradeoffs for speed and battery longevity. The CircuitPython versions of the StringCar controllers make it really easy to add and interactively adjust performance features such as motor and battery efficiency, end-of-string collision avoidance, string length calculation, and predictive braking. Also, being able to watch its own battery status means that it'll always return to the home end of the string rather than forcing me to get up from the lawn chair to manually retrieve the car from somewhere along the string. Besides being facile for adding and testing new features in real-time, CircuitPython also supports libraries that abstract string car functions, simplifying the primary code module to make it easier for novice programmers to get involved in customizing their own string car racer. Moving to the M0 and M4 versions challenged my PCB and software development skill sets significantly. Adafruit's documentation and learning guides made the journey a bit easier. Bryan (siddacious) was exceptionally helpful and encouraging."_

## Python powered Mini PiTFT – 135×240 Color TFT Add-on for Raspberry Pi

[![ Mini PiTFT](../assets/10152019/101519MiniPiTFT.gif)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4393)

Mini PiTFT – 135×240 Color TFT Add-on for Raspberry Pi – If you’re looking for the most compact li’l color display for a Raspberry Pi (most likely a Pi Zero) project, this might be just the thing you need!

[The Mini PiTFT – 135×240 Color TFT Add-on for Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4393) is your little TFT pal, ready to snap onto any and all Raspberry Pi computers, to give you a little display. The Mini PiTFT comes with a full color 240×135 pixel IPS display with great visibility at all angles. The TFT uses only the SPI port so its very fast, and we leave plenty of pins remaining available for buttons, LEDs, sensors, etc. It’s also nice and compact so it will fit into any case.

This display is super small, only about 1.14″ diagonal, but since it is an IPS display, its very readable with high contrast and visibility. We had a little space on the top so we give you two tactile buttons on GPIO pins so you can create a simple user interface. On the bottom we have a Qwiic/STEMMA QT connector for I2C sensors and device so you can plug and play any of our STEMMA QT devices.

Using the display is very easy, we have a kernel driver and Python library for the ST7789 chipset. You can set it up as a console output so you can have text and user interface through the Raspberry Pi OS or you draw images, text, whatever you like, using the Python imaging library. Our tests showed ~15 FPS update rates so you can do animations or simple video.

Comes completely pre-assembled and tested so you don’t need to do anything but plug it in and install our Python code! Works with any Raspberry Pi computer - [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4393).

CircuitPython Weekly for October 14th, 2019 [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/sGLswv_yHxk)

## Made with Mu

Does Mu work with, yes! With a note from Ntoll the creator... [Daily builds are here](http://mu-builds.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/?prefix=)...

>_"the update to OSX Catalina breaks Mu in dark and high-contrast modes (text remains black, so can't be seen). It's still fine for "day" mode, although code colouration might not work properly. I tested things this morning and it's down to the version of Qt packaged with the 1.0.2 version being old. I hope to release a new alpha version early next week that fixes the issue. BTW, the only reason it's called "alpha" is because the *new* features may not be finished or finalised. Alpha versions of Mu still have to pass all the tests and things we do for a regular release. Just letting you know in case you get folks on your forums or support channels asking."_

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy.

_"Over the past week I've been working on drivers for the LSM303AGR Accelerometer+Magnetometer by ST which is similar to but not quite the same as the LSM303DLH. Both sensors actually have two separate chips inside with different I2C addresses. Other than the AGR being significantly smaller (2x2mm!) it has a different onboard magnetometer. The two sensors now share code for the accelerometer and have separate libraries for their magnetometers. While testing the G-range settings of the new accelerometer (by whacking it with a pen of course), I found that the range settings were not sicking. After a few hours of head scratching and consulting an oracle (my logic analyzer), I discovered a bug in an underlying library that was clobbering the range setting bits while setting some adjacent bits in the same register. The bug has been fixed, things work correctly. Not today bugs, not today!"_

**Dan**

_"I'm continuing to work on some code refactoring needed to add BLE bonding. Originally some refactoring implied a whole chain of changes that became too complicated. I've now refactored the refactoring so I can do it in discrete pieces. I'm also implementing a way to read the microcontroller supply voltage from CircuitPython so you can detect when the input voltage goes low enough that the 3.3V regulator can no longer output 3.3V. This would mean, for instance, that the battery level is getting too low to run safely any more."_

**Kattni**

_"This week, we're diving back into updating guides with CircuitPython and Python Usage. Thanks to [Adafruit Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/circuitpython-raspi), you can use CircuitPython libraries on Linux computers such as the Raspberry Pi. Last year, we went through all of the existing CircuitPython libraries and published them to PyPI for use on Linux. We updated a huge number of guides with both CircuitPython and Python Usage. However, there are still a huge number left. (We have a lot of guides!) This week began with updating the [Trellis guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trellis-diy-open-source-led-keypad/python-circuitpython), and continued with the [TMP006 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/infrared-thermopile-sensor-breakout). Now we're jumping back into the project right where we left off, with MAX31856, ADXL345, and the MPR121 HAT and shield up next. All updated guides will be added to the newsletter and blogged. If you're interested in using Adafruit hardware on your Raspberry Pi or other compatible single board computer, keep an eye out for these updates!"_

**Lucian**

_"I've spent the last week working on some bugfixes, UART and DAC support. UART will require a significantly different structure than the other busio peripherals like I2C and SPI, since it needs to constantly be ready to receive new data even when the user isn't expecting it. This is especially important for GPS devices, so the feature's been put on hold until the GPS featherwing arrives. In the meantime, I've wrapped up DAC support for the STM32 boards that support it, such as the Feather F405 and the Pyboard.  Once both features are merged, I'll be moving on to some much needed cleanup of the STM32 port, and a dramatic expansion of the number of STM32 boards supported with Circuitpython. I'm also looking forward to fully testing the big pile of featherwings on my desk, and working on some spooky halloween projects."_

After that, I wrote three demos for connecting external breakouts and PiTFTs up to the Raspberry Pi. The demos are meant to be used among all of the different color displays. I started with the 2.2" TFT Breakout and am doing a sweep among all of the guides to add some Python code to it. If your favorite breakout or PiTFT display guide doesn't already have the Python code, be sure to keep an eye out for some updated."_

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/10152019/101519helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
