## Hacking Digital Calipers with CircuitPython to measure tumors

[![Calipers](../assets/07092019/7919calipers.gif)](https://www.notion.so/Hacking-Digital-Calipers-3ee7726f11ca431694dc70a1977516e4)

Save time and avoid errors with these hacked USB calipers the [Caitlyn](https://twitter.com/CaitlynBioE) and [Max](https://twitter.com/maholli404) developed. Data entered into excel with a click of a button. Caitlyn's lab does preclinical studies for novel cancer therapies. One way to determine if the therapies work is to measure tumor growth over time. It's very time consuming to manual input all the data, so they wanted an automated and affordable solution - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CaitlynBioE/status/1146249252189818880), and [how-to guide with code](https://www.notion.so/Hacking-Digital-Calipers-3ee7726f11ca431694dc70a1977516e4).

## Create a CircuitPython powered event badge with PyBadger, PyBadge and PyGamer!

[![PyBadger](../assets/07092019/7919PyBadgerOnGrey.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/pybadger-event-badge)

You're headed to the next big conference or event. They'll likely provide a badge with your name on it, but what if you could have something better?

That's where PyBadger and PyBadge (or PyGamer) come in! Use CircuitPython to easily create an interactive conference or event badge. You can display a "Hello My Name Is"-style badge that you can quickly add your name to, or customise it entirely. You can generate and display a custom QR code to direct people to your website. You can also display a "business card" with an image, such as your face or company logo, and a string of text, such as your email address.

PyBadger also gives you access to the other features on the board, such as the buttons, NeoPixels, light sensor, and accelerometer. You can easily add all kinds of features to your badge if you choose to.

CircuitPython's own Blinka is headed to the next Circuit Playground conference and wants to have the coolest badge there. This guide will walk you through Blinka creating an interactive conference badge. Follow along and customise it to fit your needs! - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/pybadger-event-badge)

## CircuitPython Turtle Graphics

[![Turtle Graphics](../assets/07092019/7919circuitpython_polygon-circle.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-turtle-graphics)

You may have heard of, or even played around with, turtle graphics. Simply put, this is a metaphor for drawing vector images where you control a turtle that can drag a pen along with it. Commands to the turtle include things like move forward some distance, turn left or right by some angle, lift the pen off the paper (so that moving won't make a mark), or put it on the paper (so that moving will make a mark).

There have been many on-screen implementations of turtle graphics, most notably the LOGO programming language. Versions have also been made that control a robot that has a pen so as to create on-paper copies of turtle drawings.

This guide introduces a turtle graphics library for CircuitPython that is built on top of displayio for use on display based boards such as the PyPortal, PyBadge, and PyGamer - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-turtle-graphics)

## Made with Mu - Alpha 2 Released with Web Mode

Mu 1.1 alpha 2 is here. [Overview from the annoucment:](https://madewith.mu/mu/users/2019/07/05/alpha2.html) Visit Mu’s download page to get installable versions for Windows and OSX. If you’re on Linux, please run Mu from source by following these instructions.

Alpha 2 contains the largest number of updates, from the most culturally diverse group of contributors for any release of Mu so far. This is a healthy sign that Mu is flourishing all over the world.

A particular highlight of such community participation is the contribution of Sean Tibor, a teacher from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. A teacher contributing code to the tools used to teach code is a wonderful sort of virtuous circle.

The full list of changes can be found in the change log for this release.

[![Mu Alpha 2](../assets/07092019/7919new_modes.png)](https://madewith.mu/mu/users/2019/07/05/alpha2.html)

The most visible update is a new web mode and the “Adafruit” mode being renamed to “CircuitPython” mode.

[![Mu Alpha 2](../assets/07092019/7919web_mode.png)](https://madewith.mu/mu/users/2019/07/05/alpha2.html)

[![Mu Alpha 2](../assets/07092019/7919mu_default_webpage.png)](https://madewith.mu/mu/users/2019/07/05/alpha2.html)

The web mode makes it very simple and easy to create dynamic web applications using the Flask web framework. As the screenshot below shows, users are currently able to edit Python, HTML, and CSS files, run a local web server and view their website in their browser.

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/07092019/7919blinka.png)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started.

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/07092019/7919hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
