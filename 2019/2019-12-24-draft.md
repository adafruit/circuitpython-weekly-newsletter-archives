## MicroPython 1.12 released!

[![MP 112](../assets/12242019/122419mp112.jpg)](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.12)

PYBD boards, BLE and littlefs, dynamic native modules, samd, powerpc and more, nice update! - [GitHub](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.12) and [forum post from Damien](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=7430).

## 94 boards on Circuitpython.org !

[![94](../assets/12242019/12241994boards.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

There are over 94+ boards on circuitpython.org. Less than half of the boards are from Adafruit, there are 40 Adafruit-made boards and 54+ from everyone else! This means there an entire ecosystem of boards out there from makers and companies around the world, all that run the open-source CircuitPython! - [circuitpython.org/downloads](https://circuitpython.org/downloads). 100 boards here we come!

[![Preview](../assets/12242019/122419preview.png)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Speaking of [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org), we'll have an update to the pages soon, this is super-seckret preview!

## CircuitPython 4.1.2 released!

[![CP 412](../assets/12242019/1224194319-05.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/4.1.2)

4.1.2 is a minor stable release. Most notably, it updates the adafruit_circuitplayground frozen library for Circuit Playground Express. It shouldn’t break any code compatible with previous 4.x releases. If you don’t have a Circuit Playground Express or a PyRuler, or a board with frozen libraries, there is no strong reason to update to 4.1.2 - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/4.1.2).

## CircuitPython 5.0.0 Beta 2 released!

[![CP beta 2](../assets/12242019/122419five1b.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases)

This is release 5.0.0 beta.2. It improves our internal filesystem definitions and may overwrite your existing files so make sure to back them up before updating! Beta releases are largely feature-complete, but are meant for testing. Use the latest stable 4.x release when first starting with CircuitPython - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases).

## Bluefruit Playground released!

>_"ZSK Laying machines for fibers and wires. The Technical Embroidery Systems of ZSK Stickmaschinen GmbH enables with the use of new and innovative techniques the laying and fixing of different media on textile and/or flexible carrier material. The laying with ZSK embroidery machines, meaning the fixing through embroidering is one of the most accurate and efficient production methods. Media like wires and any kind of fibers, tubes and optical fibers can be layed flexible and will be fixed secure and strongly through embroidery techniques like the ZigZag stitch. Materials with different conditions like Polyamid, Polyester, PPS or Aramid are available as a yarn. For products with special load requirements yarns with a steel core can be used if applicable."_

## TEAM UPDATE!

What's the team up to? Let's find out!

**Bryan**  
I've finished up the MCP4728 DAC drivers and nearly finished the guide, just waiting for product pictures. I've also written the tester code, so we're just waiting for them to get in the oven! I've also done some work on the ICM20649 tester, however that one is likely seeing a new revision before release so the tester code is on hold for a bit. Lastly I worked with Melissa and others to work on addressing some questions about the migration to github actions. Next week I'll be taking some time off for the holidays to work on some personal projects, reflect on the year and start planning for 2020. Happy holidays!

**Dan**  
I'm working on BLE bonding. There are two parts: one is doing the protocol negotiation, and the other is storing the keys and other information to make pairing automatic after the first time. I'm also bringing the UF2 bootloader up to date and looking at some mysterious zeroing of flash locations that happens very rarely, and might be due to a bootloader issue.

**Kattni**  
This week I did some PyPortaling and Feathering. I added the PyPortal Pynt to the current PyPortal guide - you can now see pinouts images and download Pynt-specific files. I finished up the PyPortal Titano guide - we made a few nifty changes from the original PyPortal and the Pynt (including USB-C!), so this big sister warranted her own guide. I also added the Feather eInk Friend to the eInk guide, so check that out for details on the new FeatherWing. As well, I spent a lot of time testing Circuit Playground code. I updated the Circuit Playground library to  be able to use a standard import line and figure out whether you're using the Express or Bluefruit automatically and import the appropriate module. This way, we can include a set of examples with the library that work with both boards without any changes necessary. This involved a number of updates to both the library and to CircuitPython itself, which meant a lot of testing! This allowed us to find some issues and fix them before release. We released CircuitPython 4.1.2 stable and 5.0.0-beta.2, both of which have the updated library available for Circuit Playground Express. Now the library is ready for future updates and future Circuit Playground boards!

Here we have a wireframe for how "JEplayer" (PT renamed it) might look -- we're aiming for showing album/track art as well as icons for interacting with the player. "Frequency by Bartlebeats is the soundtrack to your soldering" and is a free download! Other activities included audio bugfixing on nRF, heading off a bug that would have used ~4kB excess flash on circuitplayground builds, and helped Kattni get binaries she needed for testing of CPX changes before the 4.1.2 release.

**Lucian**  
I've spent this past week working on adding support for the Meowbit from Kittenbot to the STM32 port. Unfortunately, while the Meowbit has a huge array of features, the way they're combined on the board itself has made it tricky to support in circuitpython, so it's forced me to take a step back and re-evaluate my approach. To start, I'll be examining all the ways of getting code onto the STM32 series, so it's easier to recommend programming approaches for different board layouts and accommodate boards with custom bootloaders (like the Meowbit). My end goal is not just meowbit support but UF2 support across the STM32 line. This may require a return to the internal flash code, since the STM32 flash layout makes the inclusion of both a bootloader and internal flash filesystem somewhat tricky. With a better grip on the programming support, I'll also be looking into some issues with DisplayIO and PWM that recently surfaced.  Once all of that is wrapped up, I'm hoping to start adding support to a series of new boards, including the Espruinos and more Discovery boards. I'll also be keeping an eye out for any new STM32 boards that seem promising for the port!

**Melissa**  
[![Melissa](../assets/12242019/122419melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Last week started with attempting to publish a release of the PyBadger changes I had made last week and discovered that due to a software dependency, publishing new releases for CircuitPython was not working. I determined the issue was due to a recent addition to the requirements of Blinka. For the time being, that requirement has been removed from being automatically installed while we start to put in place some better infrastructure to handle the situation. I worked with Bryan, Kattni, and a couple of others to decide on a pre-installer script and that script itself is now in place. However, it will take some time to add it to all of the repositories, but afterwards, these kind of changes should be easy. I also worked on fixing the Adafruit GFX Arduino library because it wasn’t working properly on some 8-bit processors such as the Arduino Uno or Metro 328. There were some recent changes to improve support on 16-bit processors, so it just involved some minor adjustments to the code. I updated the Python Your Own Adventure CircuitPython library to support the new PyPortal Titano and the larger screen area. I also created a set of enlarged images for the basic demo that are just for the Titano. I worked on porting the Animated GIF Player that I created for the CharliePlex Displays over to the PiTFT. I am working on some speed improvements as well as some additional enhancements. I will be taking this week off for holidays, but will be back next week to finish up the Animated Gif Player and start working on some HT16K33 Library and guide updates.
