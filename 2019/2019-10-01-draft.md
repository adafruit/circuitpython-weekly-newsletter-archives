## SIPB 50: Physical Computing - Dan Halbert

[![Dan](../assets/10012019/10119dan.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Zk7WBOunlsg)

This weekend was all [SIPB 50th anniversary](https://sipb50.mit.edu/) with our very own Dan Halbert, [sipb50.mit.edu](https://sipb50.mit.edu). Dan gave a personal retrospective talk and then talked about Adafruit and demo'd CircuitPython - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Zk7WBOunlsg).

>_"For the last 50 years, the Student Information Processing Board has addressed the computing needs of the MIT Community. The services we have provided throughout the years have improved the lives of those around us. The policies we have advocated for helped shape the digital landscape of MIT. The classes and cluedumps we organize have opened doors for countless students. It is important for us as a community to reflect on the impact we made here at MIT and beyond."_

## CircuitPython Libraries on any Computer with FT232H

[![FT232H](../assets/10012019/10119FT232Hsensors_banner.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-any-computer-with-ft232h/overiew)

Powerful computers can now use the power of CircuitPython libraries. This guide will show you how to use an FT232H to connect to I2C and SPI sensors and breakouts from your desktop PC running Windows, Mac OSX, or Linux. The FT232H also allows for general purpose digital input and output (GPIO) for things like buttons and LEDs.

The cool part about this is that you can then use any of the CircuitPython Libraries that have been written for the numerous sensors and breakouts - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-any-computer-with-ft232h/overiew).

[MONSTER M4SK — HackSpace magazine](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/features/monster-m4sk) by Ben Everard ... 10 out of 10!

>_"The quality of the screen and animation is stunningly good. The original name for this eye animation (when it was first coded by Phil Burgess to work on the Teensy) was Uncanny Eyes, and they really are uncanny. For us, it’s the animation rather than the realism of the image (though this is also impressive) that gives real personality."_

## Interview with the co-creator of BOGLINS, Tim Clarke

[![Tim Clarke](../assets/10012019/10119tim.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4BA26Iwzcfk)

Check out our interview with [Tim Clarke](http://www.totims.com/) Master Toy Designer “King of Gross” - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4BA26Iwzcfk).

>_"“For over 30 years Tim has been Inventing, Designing and Sculpting some of the most unusual toys to ever be marketed in the US and abroad. Once known as the “King of Gross” after co-creating in the 80’s Sectaurs (Coleco) and Boglins (Mattel). Tim now launches his new line of horribleness the “TOTIMS” I love creating my own mythology. The world is filled with modern day mythological creatures you can find them in every nook and cranny of your bedroom closet. Tim Started his career designing and building puppets for the Muppets. Most notable were the Mystics and the Slaves that he sculpted and designed for the movie the Dark Crystal guided by the incredible drawings of Brian Froud. He also worked on puppets for Sesame Street , Muppet Show and Fraggle Rock for which he created Traveling Matt. After Dark Crystal was launched he garnered his first toy sculpting gig with Hasbro creating the Garthim, Mystics and Lanstrider toys. He has also created toys for Melissa and Doug toys, EK Success, Hasbro, Mattel, Coleco, Kenner, Ideal Lossirs, to mention just a few.”_

We met Tim after putting some cool eyes on the CircuitPython powered Monster M4SK and the community tagged each of us on Instagram, the internet _can_ work out sometimes!

>_“[Boglins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boglin) were a series of toy puppets distributed by Mattel. They were created by Tim Clarke, Maureen Trotto, and Larry Mass, and licensed by Seven Towns. The original run of Boglins was released in 1987, coinciding with a “creatures” craze that included Ghoulies, Critters, and Gremlins. Boglins were goblin-themed hand puppets made of flexible rubber and could be manipulated to represent speech and facial expressions. Several series of large and small Boglins were released until 1994, with additional aquatic, Halloween, and baby themed Boglins released later into the line. Small solid ‘Mini-Boglins’ were also produced, akin to the M.U.S.C.L.E. figures also from the 1980s.”_

> Developing applications that operate in the realm of the Internet of Things requires, in addition to the mastery of a programming language, an understanding of networking, an understanding of how to use different platforms, an understanding of basic electronic circuits, and a familiarity with databases. Owing to its built-in WiFi capability and its forty general-purpose input/output pins, the Raspberry Pi computer is the ideal device for teaching students how to write code that controls electronic circuits whether the code is executed from a keyboard attached directly to the Raspberry Pi or executed from a smart phone. One of the most popular programming languages in the world, Python, is installed with the Raspbian operating system. Several Python packages enable the programmer to write code that turns an LED or a buzzer, gets data from a sensor, controls motors, and so on.

It's also an opportunity for me to try to exercise my PyperCard library (a simple shim around Kivy, that works like HyperCard)."_

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy.

## TEAM CIRCUITPYTHON

What's the team up to this week? Let's see!

**Bryan**

[![Bryan](../assets/10012019/10119bryan.png)](https://circuitpython.org/)

>_"This week I wrote the Arduino driver for the MPU-6050 6-axis gyro and accelerometer and I'll be writing the CircuitPython driver very soon. I also managed to get the APDS-9500 doing some basic gesture detection though the code is only a very rough initial prototype in CircuitPython. Interestingly, I did this testing on my laptop in CPython using the FT232H support that was recently added to Blinka. The guide for the PCT2075 temperature sensor is out and it's in the shop!"_

**Dan**

>_"I have started to work on the persistent-storage part of bonding, adding an unfinished MicroPython PR to CircuitPython which adds LittleFS as a supported filesystem. But the current filesystem code for both FAT and LittleFS does not does not use CircuitPython's shared-bindings / shared-module style of splitting the Python interface from the implementation. This is technical debt and I will fix it. It will then be easier to call filesystem operations from core CircuitPython. I am still debugging issues with HID gamepad support. Something has changed recently which caused it to stop working."_

**Kattni**

[![Kattni](../assets/10012019/10119kattni.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-hallowing-m4)

>_The [Hallowing M4 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-hallowing-m4) is now live! Check it out for everything you need to get started with your Hallowing M4. Nicholas Tollervey has written a lovely tool called [CircUp](https://learn.adafruit.com/keep-your-circuitpython-libraries-on-devices-up-to-date-with-circup) that checks and updates the CircuitPython libraries on your board. It uses the version info in each library to verify whether they're up to date. There were a number libraries that did not have this version info available as they were created before our current setup was in place. I updated those libraries to get them working with CircUp. The guide for the MONSTER M4SK is no longer missing a [Downloads page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-monster-m4sk-eyes/downloads) - now available are links to the datasheet, PCB files, and Fritzing object, as well as images of the schematics and fab print. Next up is the Circuit Playground Bluefruit bluetooth examples - the code for the color picker is ready to go, so look for that guide page soon!"_

**Lucian**

[![Lucian](../assets/10012019/10119stm.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads?q=stm)

>_"In the past week, we successfully added support for the [STM32 F405](https://circuitpython.org/downloads?q=stm), a popular MCU used on the Pyboard and on the new, upcoming Feather F405. This week, I'm working on completing SPI support for the STM32 port, which will allow for both expanded library use and superior flash memory on both the advanced Discovery boards and upcoming Feathers. I'll also be working on some cleanup for the port structure, which should make it easier to configure the varied package types and feature differences of the STM32 lineup."_

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/10012019/10119feather_2900-10.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-oled-featherwing)

>_"This week I worked on updating some of the Monochrome Display guides such as the Adafruit FeatherWing OLED guide and the Monochrome OLED Breakouts guide. This gave me the opportunity to familiarize myself with Pillow on the Raspberry Pi, which is the modern fork of the Python Imaging Library. You can see both of those guides [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-oled-featherwing) and [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts). I updated some of the learn guide examples that were originally written for the HalloWing M0 so that they would work with the HalloWing M4 and had a lot of fun doing that. It was especially meaningful because those were some of the examples I looked at when I started learning CircuitPython. I updated my Stream Deck Message Panel guide as well and added vertical centering of the message, fixed the colors, added a single body 3D printable model for printing on larger 3D printers, and updated the corresponding guide. I’m continuing to update some of the older guides since that is needed as we develop better systems and some code starts falling a bit behind. After I’m done updating display guides, I’ll be working with the TFT Gizmo and creating some example code for an upcoming guide."_

## Coming soon

[![EDGE](../assets/10012019/10119EDGEBOARD.png)](https://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=category&cPath=1006)

EDGE BADGE!

[![STM32F405 Feather](../assets/10012019/10119stemsun.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CZ6TtvYJTeI)

The new STM32F405 Feather ([video](https://youtu.be/CZ6TtvYJTeI)) that we designed runs CircuitPython at a blistering 168MHz - our fastest CircuitPython board ever! We put a STEMMA QT / Qwiic port on the end, so you can really easily plug and play I2C sensors. With CircuitPython basics running on this board, its fast to get all our drivers working, then use the built in plotter in Mu to instantly get sensor data displaying within 3 minutes of unboxing.

>_WHAT IS STEMMA? STEMMA is not an original idea, we're working within an ecosystem of many other plug and play systems. We started [STEMMA in 2014](http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=86384236&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch), and intended to be compatible with Grove only (cause that's all that existed at the time) but then when Qwiic came around in 2017, added a smaller connector so we could work with those parts too! **STEMMA attempts to be as cross-compatible as possible with both Grove and Gravity** (compatible connectors & 3-5V power/logic). STEMMA QT is cross-compatible with Qwiic - STEMMA QT connector/cable is same as Qwiic. You can use STEMMA QT devices with Qwiic devices/controllers. Adafruit STEMMA & STEMMA QT: Plug & play connectivity - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt?view=all) If you're lookin for the differences between each and what works (and what does not), skip to the [comparison page](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt?view=all#stemma-qt-comparison)._

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/10012019/10119helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
