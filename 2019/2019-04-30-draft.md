## Happy 6th Birthday MicroPython!

[![Happy 6th Birthday MicroPython](../assets/04302019/43019hbmp.jpg)](https://www.micropython.org)

We celebrated MicroPython's 6th birthday on April 29th! Here are some important milestone dates we checked with the creator, Damien!

- 29th April 2013: first line of code written (in private, before anyone knew about it, before it was even called Micro-Python)
- 17th Sept 2013: first code running on a microcontroller, on the very first prototype of the pyboard
- 2nd Oct 2013: register micropython.org
- 4th Oct 2013: first commit in what is now the main repository
- late Dec 2013: source code up on GitHub
- 21st June 2014: last of the Kickstarter rewards sent out (for the first Kickstarter)

The Early Days of MicroPython - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/NBAqOYYW6vM).

>_April 29, 2019 is the sixth 'birthday' of MicroPython. At the April Melbourne Meetup, Damien George, creator of MicroPython, delves into his archives and shows the earliest code and notes about the goals of the language. The material pre-dates the first git commit! Listen in as Damien reveals how and why the language began and evolved. It's a nice way to celebrate MicroPython's sixth birthday!_

[In newsletter #8 from MicroPython, Damien published](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=6356) some never-before-seen details about the start of MicroPython.

Here is an excerpt from the initial notes. The title is "Python board" and the date is 29 April 2013:

Python board                                        29/4/2013

The smallest, cheapest python.

A piece of hardware that is small and cheap, runs python scripts, and has good low-level access to hardware.  If we can do it with a single chip, that would keep it small and cheap.  Need then something with a large amount of flash and a decent amount of RAM, that also is cheap enough.  Atmel SAM's have order 1MiB flash and 128KiB SRAM, for around $10 one-off.

Main features:
* Implements Python 3 core language.
* Flash presents as a flash drive with vfat filesystem.
* Put python scripts on flash and it runs them (maybe have a (multicolour?) led that flashes on error and writes a "core" dump to the flash).  This led can also double as a user output led.
* Can run multiple scripts on once.

Our strength would be small, cheap, simple, easy to replicate.

Can have a range of boards with different features.  But all must be basically compatible and capable of running the same
scripts.

Happy Birthday MicroPython! Thank you Damien for creating something special and open!

## CircuitPython Release Candidate 1!

This is it! We think Release Candidate 1 is stable but want you to test it out to be sure. If we don't find anything major, then this will be the 4.0.0 release. If there are any fixes to make we'll follow up with another release candidate.

Download it from [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

If you find a bug please check the current known issues and [file an issue](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/new) if something isn't already known.

[![CircuitPython boot diagram](../assets/04302019/43019cpbs.png)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

And with an RC1 we have an updated CircuitPython boot diagram.

## Adafruit PyBadge for CircuitPython

[![Adafruit PyBadge for CircuitPython](../assets/04302019/43019pybadge.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200)

It's here! What's the size of a credit card and can run CircuitPython? That's right, it's the [Adafruit PyBadge!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200) We wanted to see how much we could cram into a 3 3⁄8 × 2 1⁄8 inch rounded rectangle, to make an all-in-one dev board with a lot of possibilities, and this is what we came up with.

The PyBadge is a compact board, like we said, it's credit card sized. It's powered by our favorite chip, the ATSAMD51, with 512KB of flash and 192KB of RAM. We add 2 MB of QSPI flash for file storage, handy for images, fonts, sounds, or game assets.

On the front you get a 1.8" 160x128 color TFT display with dimmable backlight - we have fast DMA support for drawing so updates are incredibly fast. There's also 8 silicone-top buttons, they are clicky but have a soft button top so they're nice and grippy. The buttons are arranged to mimic a gaming handheld, with a d-pad, 2 menu-select buttons and 2 fire-action buttons. There's also 5 NeoPixel LEDs to dazzle or track activity.

On the back we have a full Feather-compatible header socket set, so you can plug in any FeatherWing to expand the capabilities of the PyBadge. There's also 3 STEMMA connectors - two 3-pin with ADC/PWM capability and one 4-pin that connects to I2C - you can use this for Grove sensors as well.

## CircuitPython snakes its way to wearables!

## Digi-Key + Adafruit @ PyCon!

**THIS IS IT, IT BEGINS NOWS!**

[![PyCon](../assets/04232019/42319pycon.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

PyCon 2019 returns May 1–9, 2019 to Cleveland, OH – with talks, tutorials, sprints, and more! 

[![PyCon](../assets/04232019/42319pycdigikey.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

Big news! Digi-Key and Adafruit have teamed up for PyCon 2019 so every attendee (about 4,000!) will receive a [SPECIAL EDITION Circuit Playground Express](https://youtu.be/ZMx6qB-7z9U), running … CircuitPython.

[![PyCon](../assets/04302019/43019pyconboards.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

This effort is to get Python on hardware to the most folks out there, at the events that bring people together.

This is just one of many efforts we’re teaming up with Digi-Key to continue to fuel all the developers from beginners to pro, using Python on microcontrollers.

[![PyCon](../assets/04302019/43019team.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!

The PyCon 2019 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.

Scott will be leading a talk at the **Python Language Summit, History of CircuitPython**. The Python Language Summit is an event for the developers of Python implementations (CPython, PyPy, Jython, and so on) to share information, discuss our shared problems, and — hopefully — solve them - [pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit](https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/)
