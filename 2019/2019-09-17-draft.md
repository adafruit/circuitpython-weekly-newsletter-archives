## CircuitPython snakes its way to the STM32

[![CircuitPython snakes its way to the STM32](../assets/09172019/91719stm32.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xA8q0Xs22-E)

CircuitPython snakes its way to the STM32! Here's a preview of us testing analog input on ST32F4 port of CircuitPython using Mu. Did you know we're working on STM32 support for CircuitPython? Its slowly coming together! Here's the STM32F412 Discovery board from ST, running a simple sketch to test analog inputs. We use Mu to edit the Python code on the device and the plotter makes testing easy, twist & look! - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/xA8q0Xs22-E).

Download the very first builds from [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org)! They are available for the [STM32F411 Discovery](https://circuitpython.org/board/stm32f411ve_discovery/) and the [STM32F412 Discovery](https://circuitpython.org/board/stm32f412zg_discovery/).

## CircuitPython 5.0.0 Alpha 4 released!

[![Alpha](../assets/09172019/91719poster.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

CircuitPython 5.0.0-alpha.4 was released over the weekend and includes initial support for the STM32, adds I2SOut for the nRF52840 and a number of other fixes. If you are one of the lucky folks who has a [CircuitPlayground Bluefruit](https://circuitpython.org/board/circuitplayground_bluefruit/), we recommend updating now to get a couple board specific fixes. Download the release from [CircuitPython.org/downloads](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)!

## Serpente - A Tiny CircuitPython Prototyping Board

[![A Tiny CircuitPython Prototyping Board](../assets/09172019/91719serp.jpg)](https://www.tindie.com/products/arturo182/serpente-a-tiny-circuitpython-prototyping-board/)

The Serpente boards are low-cost development boards designed to be used with Adafruit’s CircuitPython. They are both virtually the same, except for the USB connector. The standard Serpente board contains a USB Type-C connector, and the Serpente Plug uses the board itself as a Type-A USB plug. If you are familiar with the Digispark boards, you may notice some similarities. This fact is of course not incidental, the Serpente boards are inspired by the Digispark, both in form-factor as well as use-cases. The Serpente boards are meant to be used as quick and dirty, yet flexible, prototyping tools - [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/arturo182/serpente-a-tiny-circuitpython-prototyping-board/) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1173662286021582848).

## Hanselminutes Technology Podcast – Learning CircuitPython with Scott Shawcroft

[![Hanselminutes Technology Podcast](../assets/09172019/91719scottcast.jpg)](https://www.hanselminutes.com/701/learning-circuitpython-with-scott-shawcroft)

Hanselminutes Technology Podcast – Fresh Air and Fresh Perspectives for Developers – [Learning CircuitPython with Scott Shawcroft](https://www.hanselminutes.com/701/learning-circuitpython-with-scott-shawcroft):

>_"CircuitPython is a programming language designed to simplify experimenting and learning to code on low-cost microcontroller boards. The history of CircuitPython begins with MicroPython, a Python interpreter written from scratch for embedded systems by Damien George starting in 2013. Three years later, Adafruit hired Shawcroft to port MicroPython to the SAMD21 chip they use on many of their boards. The Scott talks about how to lower the barrier to entry and how to enable beginners to be productive with CircuitPython."_

[Call for Proposals for PyCon 2020 is open](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2019/09/call-for-proposals-for-pycon-2020-is.html) -

>_"We need beginner, intermediate, and advanced proposals on all sorts of topics as well as beginner, intermediate, and advanced speakers to present talks. You don’t need to be a 20-year veteran who has spoken at dozens of conferences. On all fronts, we need all types of people. That’s what this community is comprised of, so that’s what this conference’s schedule should be made from."_

## The S in IoT stands for security

[![The S in IoT stands for security](../assets/09172019/91719iots.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ISHqKL1okno)

The running joke is that the ‘S’ in IoT stands for security…cause its never there. But safety and security is something you will need to think about at all steps of your design process. There’s going to be billions of IoT devices on-line around the world, many of which will be connected to the Internet, and almost all of them will be unmonitored. A 2015 survey by authentication service provider Auth0 found that 85% of IoT developers admitted to being pressured to get a product to market before adequate security could be implemented. And as an engineer, you’re probably used to that pressure to get a product to market, in which case, selling features often get more attention than security.

With more and more of these connected devices being rushed to market, they’ve become a lucrative target. The 2016 Mirai botnet attack used unsecured CCTV cameras that were connected to the Internet to launch a crippling denial of service attack. That one wasn’t even using the cameras to spy on people, it was just using the TCP/IP stack of the embedded linux device to send lots of junk traffic.

Having security as a priority for your engineering and marketing team will not just help you sleep well at night. As we’ve seen with the European GDPR regulations, privacy and security are being legislated. Having poor security will now get you fined and banned in the marketplace. It’s nearly impossible to add security after the fact, so if you want to avoid a devastating recall – listen up and take security seriously.

[![Bryan](../assets/09172019/91719bryan03.gif)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

_"This week I wrote the guide for the TLV493D magnetometer as well as the PCT2075 temperature sensor. The PCT2075 also got brand new drivers. It's a sweet little sensor, good at doing what little it does, which is essentially act like a thermostat, measuring the temperature and letting you know if it goes past a temperature threshold you set. I also built and started testing the latest revision of the large OLED bonnet. It's working but the drivers need some love to display things properly: I'll be working on the libraries for the SSD1305 controller chip that the OLED in the bonnet uses to make the best of such a nice display."_

**Dan**

_"I’m continuing to work on BLE bonding in CircuitPython. I’m also in touch with the developers who are adding BLE support to MicroPython. We have complementary ideas and experience that will improve both of our implementations. I’m debugging gamepad support on Windows and on the Xbox Assistive Controller, in conjunction with Bill Binko of ATMakers. When done, this will make the XAC useful for even more folks. I fixed an issue that interfered with using the status NeoPixel on some boards. It was really two bugs in one."_

**Lucian**

_"I'm working through a rework of the internals of pin organization for the STM32 port of CircuitPython, and getting the AnalogIO module up and running. Past that, I'll be working on doing the same for more complex modules, such as SPI and UART, as well as expanding support across the STM32 line of chips and development boards."_ 

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/09172019/91719jeff01.png)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

_"In the core, I continued to concentrate on audio features.  This past weekend, I added I2SOut to the nRF52840 port, and learned a lot about I2S in the process. This has been pulled into the CircuitPython master branch, so boards like the Feather nRF52840 Express and Circuit Playground Bluefruit will be able to use compatible audio devices in CircuitPython 5.0. Image shows three waveforms in the I2S protocol.  Top: bit clock.  Middle: Left/Right Clock.  Bottom: PCM encoded Audio Data."_

[![Jeff](../assets/09172019/91719jeff02.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

_"For fun, I created a prototype PCB that bridges between the "USER PORT" (serial port) of the classic Commodore 64 computer and any Feather.  Potential uses include developing CircuitPython programs on this unconventional system, creating new interfaces between the C64 and modern I2C / SPI sensors, or even adding wireless capabilities. Image shows a hand holding a purple PCB with large blue USER PORT connector and Feather HUZZAH32 module."_

**Kattni**

[![Kattni](../assets/09172019/91719adafruit_products_CPB_Rainbow_LEDs_Held.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

_"This week I've been working on the Circuit Playground Bluefruit Learn guide. I've been testing it against all the Circuit Playground Express code, some of which required small updates to work for both. I discovered a bug in the board definition for the CPB - pin A1 and A5 were assigned to the same pin, so A1 didn't work as expected. Bugs like this are exactly why I'm testing everything. I also found a library that's not compatible with the CPB, and got an issue filed there to get that fixed up. For the most part, everything works exactly the same way, which is the expected result. Look for the guide soon!"_

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/09172019/91719sensors_blinkapi.png)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

_"This week I just published a new learn guide about getting CircuitPython up and running on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. You can view the guide [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-libraries-on-linux-and-the-nvidia-jetson-nano). Now I'm starting a new Learn guide for Nicholas Tollervey's circup, which is a utility to allow you to keep up to date on the latest CircuitPython libraries. I will also be working on cleaning up a few outstanding Blinka issues and guides."_

**Scott**

_"I've wrapped up displayio work for now and have dove into the land of Bluetooth Low Energy. I polished up our old Basic Chat sample app to Swift 5 and begun expanding the BLE library. Next steps are to hook the CircuitPython work up into basic mobile apps."_

As displays have gotten smaller and higher res, we've seen some really cute mini TFTs. this one is only 1.1" but has 240x135 pixels, great for a little display. we wrote a kernel driver for it, and with the STEMMA QT connector on the bottom, its ez to connect sensors like this MSA301. Then run python scripts to print out the motion output. Fun! - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/DR8Q3fwvGZY).

We're putting our lil miniPiTFT through some tests, this one is running our TensorFlow Lite tutorial for object recognition, and using the 240x165 pixel screen to see inference output. Makes it a little easier to know what the machine is seeing! - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Yd8mRMDbpCQ).

We are also trying out Google Assistant on the BrainCraft HAT - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/a9f3Zud65MU). The BrainCraft HAT we've designed has gone through some tests with vision recognition and TensorFlow with great success! Now we're ready to try it with voice recognition. We installed the free Google Assistant code - took only about 20 minutes to set up - now we can use it as an audio assistant thanks to the onboard microphones and speaker amplifier!

The [Adafruit Monster M4sk](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4343) just happens to fit perfectly in a BOGLIN! - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ah_opx9Q5Tg). [What is a BOGLIN??](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boglin)

>_"Boglins were a series of toy puppets distributed by Mattel. They were created by Tim Clarke, Maureen Trotto, and Larry Mass, and licensed by Seven Towns. The original run of Boglins was released in 1987, coinciding with a "creatures" craze that included Ghoulies, Critters, and Gremlins. Boglins were goblin-themed hand puppets made of flexible rubber and could be manipulated to represent speech and facial expressions. Several series of large and small Boglins were released until 1994, with additional aquatic, Halloween, and baby themed Boglins released later into the line. Small solid 'Mini-Boglins' were also produced, akin to the M.U.S.C.L.E. figures also from the 1980s."_
