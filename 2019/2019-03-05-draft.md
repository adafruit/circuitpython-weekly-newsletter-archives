## A Halo for Lucy – helping a dog avoid collisions using CircuitPython

[![Lucy]({{ "/assets/3519lucy.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://hackaday.io/project/163920-a-halo-for-lucy)

Meet Lucy, a seven year-old border collie schipperke mix. 18 months ago she was diagnosed with Progressive Retinal Atrophy — she is not getting enough blood flow to her retinae and she is slowly going blind. There is no cure.

Owner Bud Bennett purchased a halo. It is a metal hoop that surrounds her head. If she inadvertently gets too close to an object the halo will collide with the object instead of her head.  The contraption looks uncomfortable, but Lucy has tolerated it the few times she was burdened her with it.

Bud has begun to investigate an alternative to the halo using CircuitPython - [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/163920-a-halo-for-lucy)

## Add lights to a cosplay helmet with CircuitPython

[![Sophy]({{ "/assets/3519sophy.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}]()

From Issue 16 — HackSpace magazine, an intermediate project by Sophy Wong, some light soldering, create a simple program with CircuitPython, and even craft custom diffusers for external lights. To control the circuit, it uses the ItsyBitsy M0 Express from Adafruit. The ItsyBitsy gives you room to grow if you want to add more functionality to the helmet in the future. Maybe a voice changer? Or sci-fi sound samples triggered by capacitive touch areas on the helmet? The possibilities are endless, and once you’ve got your ItsyBitsy installed, it’s easy to reprogram with CircuitPython whenever you get a new idea.

## HackSpace magazine - Adafruit Grand Central M4 Express review 9 out of 10!

Thye Python-powered Adafruit Grand Central M4 Express received a 9 out of 10 in HackSpace magazine! The Grand Central M4 Express packs a huge amount onto a microcontroller board. There’s enough IO to control almost anything, and the processing power to crunch through the massive amount of data it’s capable of bringing in. As the name suggests, it’s not the smallest board, but if you’ve got the room, this is a great brain for IO-hungry projects - [HackSpace](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/features/adafruit-grand-central-m4-express-review).

## PyPortal and adafruit.io

[![PyPortal Forcast]({{ "/assets/3519cic.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://twitter.com/ronhiltz/status/1102013771420188673)

There are going to be a lot of projects that use [adafruit.io](https://io.adafruit.com/) (free internet of things service from Adafruit, for makers) and PyPortal, we shipped a few units out and within a few hours the demos and examples started pouring in! Here's a forcast, as in a metric, not the weath, display from Ron - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ronhiltz/status/1102013771420188673).

## CircuitPython snakes its way to the SAM32

## New Atom package, now for safe CircuitPython editing 

[![Atom]({{ "/assets/3519atom.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/27/new-atom-package-for-safe-circuitpython-editing-circuitpython/)

Atom is a popular multi-platform text editor, with excellent Python support, great for use with CircuitPython. But out of the box it may not edit files on a CIRCUITPY drive safely, because it doesn’t force all the data in a file to be written out immediately to the drive when you save. We’ve created a simple Atom package, fsync-on-save, to do this for you. This package replaces an older one, circuitpython-force-to-drive, which is now obsolete and has been deleted. The older package didn’t handle CIRCUITPY drives that had been renamed to some other name.

This immediate-write problem is only an issue on Windows and Linux. MacOS always writes out all the data to CIRCUITPY immediately, without help, so you don’t need fsync-on-save on MacOS. For more information about safe editing, check out this section on editing code in the Welcome to CircuitPython Learn Guide - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/27/new-atom-package-for-safe-circuitpython-editing-circuitpython/).

[![PyperCard]({{ "/assets/3519pypercard01.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard)

[![PyperCard]({{ "/assets/3519pypercard02.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard)

HyperCard was released 32 years ago (in 1987), and we're going to pay a bit of a tribute to it with some PyPortal projects, including making a great button to start.

What is HyperCard? *HyperCard was a piece of application software and a programming tool for Apple Macintosh and Apple IIGS computers. It was among the first successful hypermedia systems before the World Wide Web.*

*HyperCard combined a flat-file database with a graphical, flexible, user-modifiable interface.[2] HyperCard also included a built-in programming language called HyperTalk for manipulating data and the user interface.*

*This combination of features – a database with simple form layout, flexible support for graphics, and ease of programming – led many people to use HyperCard for many different projects. Some people used HyperCard as a programming tool for rapid application development of applications and databases, others for building interactive applications with no database requirements, command and control systems, and many examples in the demoscene.*

*HyperCard was originally released in 1987 for $49.95 and was included for free with all new Macs sold then.[1] It was withdrawn from sale in March 2004, having received its final update in 1998. HyperCard ran in the Classic Environment, but was not ported to Mac OS X.* - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard).

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/3519pycon01.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

PyCon 2019 returns May 1–9, 2019 to Cleveland, OH – with talks, tutorials, sprints, and more! 

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/3519pyconDigi-Key.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

Big news! Digi-Key and Adafruit have teamed up for PyCon 2019 so every attendee (about 4,000!) will receive a [SPECIAL EDITION Circuit Playground Express](https://youtu.be/ZMx6qB-7z9U), running … CircuitPython.

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/3519pyconboards.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

This effort is to get Python on hardware to the most folks out there, at the events that bring people together.

This is just one of many efforts we’re teaming up with Digi-Key to continue to fuel all the developers from beginners to pro, using Python on microcontrollers.

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/3519pyconteam.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!

The PyCon 2019 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.

We will have a lot more updates, stay tuned to the [Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit), [Discord](http://adafru.it/discord), and more!

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/3519hello.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
