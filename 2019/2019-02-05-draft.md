## CircuitPython snakes its way to TI calculators

[![CircuitPython snakes its way to TI calculators]({{ "/assets/2519ti01.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/28/ti-planet-ti-python-import-sys-reveals-adafruit-circuitpython-on-ti-83-premium-ce-calculator-tiplanetnews-ticalculators-circuitpython-circuitpython/)

Spotted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tiplanetnews/status/1089999080854417408) … [TI-Planet | TI-Python: import sys reveals CircuitPython Adafruit!](https://tiplanet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22263&p=239184&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#p239184). If we’re reading this correctly the upcoming TI-83 Premium CE calculator will have a TI-Python adapter that runs CircuitPython the first quarter of 2019! ([gallery](https://tiplanet.org/forum/gallery/image_page.php?album_id=558&image_id=10012)).

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/2519libs.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **131**!

**New Libraries!**

Here's this week's new CircuitPython libraries:

* [Adafruit CircuitPython RA8875](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_RA8875)

* [Adafruit CircuitPython MIDI](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MIDI)

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/2519hello.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).

## 10,398 thanks!
