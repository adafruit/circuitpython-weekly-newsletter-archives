>_"A talk by Scott Shawcroft! CircuitPython makes programming hardware easier than ever by bringing the popular Python language to modern, inexpensive 32-bit microcontrollers. This doesn’t need to be limited to modern hardware though. By pairing a modern microcontroller running CircuitPython and a vintage computer, such as a GameBoy or Yamaha piano keyboard, you can unlock the unique characteristics of these vintage devices. In this talk, you’ll learn the basics of how CircuitPython makes coding easy, how it works under the hood, and how to extend CircuitPython with C. As an example, we’ll supercharge a Nintendo GameBoy with CircuitPython. By the end of the talk, you’ll be able to supercharge your own hardware project with CircuitPython. Scott is the project lead for CircuitPython and is sponsored by Adafruit Industries, an open source electronics company. After a number of years at Google working in the cloud, Scott left to learn about electronics on his own. He began freelancing a year later for Adafruit on what became CircuitPython. Now, CircuitPython ships on thousands of electronics every month, introducing new coders to Python on hardware. Scott’s hobby is bringing CircuitPython to as many devices as possible, including those he finds at thrift stores such as GameBoys and Yamaha Keyboards."_

## Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is here, BLINKA'ing it now :)

[![Pi 4](../assets/06252019/62519pi4.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VpG9r7CMTYs)

The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, [our video here](https://youtu.be/VpG9r7CMTYs), is the newest Raspberry Pi computer made, and the Pi Foundation knows you can always make a good thing better! And what could make the Pi 4 better than the 3? How about a faster processor, USB 3.0 ports, and updated Gigabit Ethernet chip with PoE capability? Good guess – that’s exactly what they did!

The Raspberry Pi 4 is the latest product in the Raspberry Pi range, boasting an updated 64-bit quad core processor running at 1.4GHz with built-in metal heatsink, USB 3 ports, dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless LAN, faster (300 mbps) Ethernet, and PoE capability via a separate PoE HAT.

The dual-band wireless LAN comes with modular compliance certification, that’s the metal tin in the corner of the Pi, with the logo stamped on it. This allows the board to be designed into end products with significantly reduced wireless LAN compliance testing, improving both cost and time to market.

We are doing our tests, and expect to see it on [circuitpython.org/blinka](https://circuitpython.org/blinka) any moment.

## CircuitPython Choose Your Own Adventure

[![PYOA](../assets/06252019/62519pyoa.png)](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-python-choose-you-own-adventure?view=all)

This is our new framework to write choose your own adventure style stories! It's somewhat "HyperCard"-like, so we've also called it PyperCard :) This concept is from a series of very popular children's books in the 1980s and 90s. A more modern implementation is the Bandersnatch episode of Netflix's Black Mirror series. The basic idea is that at various points in the story, the reader is given a choice about how to proceed. Those choices take the reader down different paths, eventually leading to alternative endings. This guide is an introduction to the PYOA application that lets you write and run your own adventures on the PyPortal complete with images, sounds, text, and choices - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-python-choose-you-own-adventure?view=all)

## CircuitPython snakes its way to HackSpace Issue 20!

[![HackSpace Issue 20](../assets/06252019/62519hs20.png)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/20)

Ben Everard in HackSpace Magazine writes about using CircuitPython to easily turn an Adafruit Circuit Playground Express educational/multifunction board  into a USB-connected game controller.

>_"We’re going to look at a really simple game inspired by Moon Buggy – an old terminal-based Unix game where you’re driving a buggy across the moon, and have to jump over boulders that litter your path. In our game, we’ll use the ten pixels on a Circuit Playground Express to represent our moon, with red pixels indicating rocks, and white pixels representing our buggy as it drives around this tiny planet. Touching one of the pins will be the only input to the game – it will make the buggy jump for one step. If you hit this, you can clear a rock and keep going, otherwise, you crash out and have to start again."_

[![HackSpace Issue 20](../assets/06252019/62519hs2002.jpg)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/20)

It takes less than 50 lines of Python to get this game running, here shown in the Mu editor. See the full write-up in Issue 20 of HackSpace Magazine - [PDF pages 86 to 87](https://magazines-static.raspberrypi.org/issues/full_pdfs/000/000/087/original/HackSpacemagazine20.pdf).

## CircuitPython-powered Modular NeoPixel patches

[![HackSpace Issue 20](../assets/06252019/62519swhs.jpg)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/20)

Also from HackSpace, Modular NeoPixel patches by Sophy Wong -

>_"What could possibly be more amazing than hook-and-loop tape? Conductive hook-and loop tape! That’s right, your favourite fastener is available in a silver-coated version that is perfect for making a modular circuit with custom swappable components. In this tutorial, we’ll use it to create modular NeoPixel patches for a jacket. The microcontroller and battery for this circuit will be located in the jacket, and be connected to the loop side of the hook-and-loop tape. NeoPixel LEDs will be sewn into the removable patches. Whichever patch you slap onto your jacket will light up!"_

A Gemma M0 microcontroller from Adafruit will control the NeoPixels, and we’ll program the Gemma with CircuitPython. You can read Sophy’s full tutorial in Issue 20 of HackSpace Magazine - [PDF pages 96 to 97](https://magazines-static.raspberrypi.org/issues/full_pdfs/000/000/087/original/HackSpacemagazine20.pdf).

## Qwiic! Ported to CircuitPython!

[![Qwiic](../assets/06252019/62519qwiic.jpg)](https://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=50199&p=205301#p205301)

Gaston Williams aka Fourstix writes -

>_"I have ported the Qwiic Joystick, Qwiic Relay and Qwiic Twist Arduino libraries to CircuitPython libraries. All the example programs were also ported, so one can follow along the Sparkfun Arduino tutorials and Hookup Guides with a Raspberry Pi using these CircuitPython classes and the python example code. The Arduino function names were converted to Python following PEP8 style rules. Single value getter/setter methods were converted to Python class properties. For example, joystick.getHorizontal() in Arduino code becomes joystick.horizontal in python code. The Arduino methods relayOn() and relayOff() become relay_on() and relay_off() in python, and so on. These libraries were released to the CircuitPython Community Repository. The source code, examples, installation information and documentation are available on GitHub."_

>_"Developing a Blocked Based Language for the Adafruit Circuit Playground. ABSTRACT. With the growing use of technology in our everyday lives, the need for more people who can program and understand technology is increasing. However, the engaging resources to teach computer science incorporating hardware components to children and first-learners, are limited. To combat this issue, a block-based language was developed using Google’s Blockly Developer Tools. The Blockly library injects an editor into an HTML file that represents coding concepts as interlocking blocks, and then outputs the blocks as syntactically correct code. This block-based language, appropriately named CodePlayground, was designed to be compatible with the Adafruit Circuit Playground. The Circuit Playground was released as a all in one low cost device that can be used for education. CodePlayground allows teachers to utilize the Circuit Playground as an educational device that includes both hardware and software elements. The Circuit Playground uses the firmata provided by Adafruit to communicate with the Python code generated by CodePlayground. Blockly Developer Tools was used to create the frame for the language and Atom was used to insert the specialized JavaScript for code generation. After the language was complete, 90 sample programs were created then given a score on a scale to 0 to 2 based on difficulty and their ability to generate and run code, with 2 being the most difficult and most successful, respectively. All of the programs successfully generated code and ran 94% of the time, demonstrating that CodePlayground could be used in an educational setting."_
