**PyRuler - Engineer Reference Ruler with CircuitPython**

[![PyRuler](../assets/08062019/8619pyruler.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4319)

The first time you soldered up a surface mount component you may have been surprised "these are really small parts!" and there's a dozen of different names too! QFN, TDFN, SOIC, SOP, J-Lead, what do they mean and how can you tell how big they are? Now you can have a reference board at your fingertips with this snazzy PCB reference ruler.

Measuring approx 1" x 6" standard-thickness FR4, this gold plated ruler has the most common component packages you'll encounter. It also has font size guide, trace-width diagram, and a set of AWG-sized drills so you can gauge your wire thicknesses.

That's not all, it's even a fully featured microcontroller board! Embedded in the end is a Trinket M0, our little Cortex M0+ development board, and in addition, there are 4 capacitive touch pads with matching LEDs that our code will turn into a specialized engineer keyboard. We're always needing to type Ω and µ, but we can never memorize the complex key-commands necessary. Thanks to CircuitPython, it's super-easy to make a touch keyboard to solve this for you. Plug in the ruler into your computer, if it's your first time using it, you'll need to open up the code.py file and set the Keyboard mode to "True". Now when you touch the pads, you'll get a Ω, µ, π, or, when the Digi-Key logo is touched, the URL for Digi-Key's Python on Hardware guide - [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4319).

[![Kattni PyOhio keynote video](../assets/08062019/8619kattni.jpg)](https://youtu.be/-bBHXimlfPQ)

>_"In trying to learn Python, I stumbled into a passion I had never considered. My path began with learning Python on hardware. Through mentorship and the help of friends, I began to flourish. Since then I have continued to contribute in ways I never thought possible, between code, community, and becoming a mentor myself. This is the story of my journey and how mentorship can change lives."_ - [pyohio.org](https://pyohio.org), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/-bBHXimlfPQ).

## Accelerating Driver Development with CircuitPython

[![Accelerating Driver Development with CircuitPython](../assets/08062019/8619pybaybs.jpg)](https://pybay.com/speaker/bryan-siepert/)

An introduction to Python on hardware from the perspective of writing device drivers for embedded systems, [Bryan Siepert - PyBay](https://pybay.com/speaker/bryan-siepert/).

>_"My talk will start with an overview of embedded development and working with sensors, highlighting differences compared to normal computing. Once the broad strokes are covered I will explain the high level goals and techniques of writing drivers specifically before diving into the details I will first discuss using datasheets to determine how a device works and what it's capabilities are. Following that I will discuss using the device’s capabilities by writing to and reading from registers and will include a review of basic bitwise operations. Next will discuss the common communication protocols used in embedded development before talking about the CircuitPython libraries that support them. Finally I will discuss some newer libraries that I use that make developing drivers very simple and compare it with traditional embedded development practices."_

## CircuitPython 4.1.0 Released!

## CircuitPython editing and saving on iOS is here!

[![iOSPython](../assets/08062019/8619ipadYAY.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/07/30/its-now-possible-to-open-edit-and-save-python-code-on-ios-for-embedded-electronics-plugged-in-circuitpython-usb-devices-apple-ios-circuitpython/)

It’s now possible to open, edit, and save Python code on iOS for embedded electronics plugged in, CircuitPython USB devices. This is a follow up to [our post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/06/25/ios-13-beta-1-erases-files-off-drive-resets-ipad-fat12-issue-it-seems-apple/) about Apple’s iOS 13 beta, which is now up to beta 5.

The upcoming [iOS 13](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-13-preview/) allows iPads (and iPhones) to be more like computers, which means you’ll be able to do computer-like things such as plugging in a USB drive, opening up the Files app in iOS 13 and browsing the files. This is going to be fantastic for folks who want to use an iPad as their full-time desktop replacement, and if you’re a coder it looks like you’ll be able to do things like opening up Python .py files, use IDEs for coding, etc. A lot of schools use iPads, so this means any iPad will be able to be used to code for electronics: if the app can open a text file, it can be used to write Python.

iOS 13 beta 1 had some troubles: it deleted files off some devices that act like USB drives, for example, all the CircuitPython boards. But now the GOOD NEWS: we filed a bug report, and since iOS beta 5 IT IS ALL WORKING! This means any code editor for iOS can be used as a code editor for CircuitPython and you’ll be able to open, edit, and save your code to the device(s) plugged in to the iOS device!

Here’s a quick summary of how to edit a CircuitPython file now on an iPad running iOS 13 beta 5: plug in a CircuitPython board, such as a Circuit Playground Express, select a file on CIRCUITPY, drag or copy/paste the file to “On My iPad”, use an editor to change the file, then delete the original file on CIRCUITPY, copy/paste, share, or drag the file back to CIRCUITPY, giving it a new name, rename and it all saves and runs automatically. It’s awesome. The code editing apps are not aware of this new “USB storage” in iOS 13 yet; when they are (soon), it will be even easier. For now, just use the iOS Files app to move the files around.

Also, iOS 13 beta 5 clearly still has some bugs: you can’t save the file with its original name, so you need to to save with a new name, delete the old file, and rename the new file.

## CircuitPython sneks its way to Snek!

[![Snek](../assets/08062019/8619snek.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/board/snekboard/)

[![Snek](../assets/08062019/8619snek02.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/board/snekboard/)

Snekboard is designed to hook up to Lego Power Functions motors and switches, allowing you to build robots out of Lego and control them with CircuitPython or the simpler snek programming language. Snekboard is 48mm × 48mm, which is the same size as 6 x 6 Lego studs allowing you to build a box out of Lego to hold it attached to your Leo design. It uses a single cell lithium polymer battery that fits under the board and charges over USB while snekboard is being programmed from the host - [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/board/snekboard/) & [keithhp.com](https://keithp.com/snek/snekboard/)

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy.

We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated learn guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/08062019/8619blinka.png)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/08062019/8619hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
