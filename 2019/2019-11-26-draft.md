## Python snakes its way to more newsstands

[![Python newsstand](../assets/11262019/11261901.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%22we+are+what+we+celebrate%22&posts=ALL)

[![Python newsstand](../assets/11262019/11261902.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%22we+are+what+we+celebrate%22&posts=ALL)

Magazine covers, even now, are still are one the places we as a society decide to celebrate specific people in some way. For business and tech publications, who, or what, we put on the cover and why says what’s important to us, what we’ve done, and where we are going.

For years we’ve done a feature here on Adafruit called “We are what we celebrate” which is a quick look at what is one the newsstands. Check out all the posts [“We are what we celebrate”](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%22we+are+what+we+celebrate%22&posts=ALL) on the Adafruit blog.

On a specific Python note, we're seeing more and more Python, and Python on hardware articles, books, and magazines - a welcome addition to newsstands.

[![CircuitPython and Bluetooth Low Energy by Ben Everard](../assets/11262019/112619page82-83.jpg)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/25)

What else? [CircuitPython and Bluetooth Low Energy](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/25) by Ben Everard, Link your phone to your microcontroller to send data and commands –

>_"Bluetooth is in a bit of a funny position in the maker world. While theoretically it is really well placed to be a great addition to the maker toolkit, historically it’s not been widely utilised because it’s been hard to use. Part of the problem is the need to write two bits of software – one for the microcontroller, and one for whatever you’re sending data to it with, whether that’s a phone or computer. Where WiFi has enabled makers to do one side with a simple bit of HTML, Bluetooth has often needed a fully featured app. There’s also a bit of confusion about names – Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) are different things, yet are both often lumped under the moniker ‘Bluetooth’. We’ll be using BLE. Things are getting a little easier thanks to a really easy-to-use set of modules in CircuitPython and the Adafruit Bluefruit app."_

## Testing CircuitPython Modules

Nicholas Tollervey's post about the latest testing of the radio module -

>_"I was privileged to recently complete a block of work for Adafruit: I've written a CircuitPython module called adafruit_radio that makes it easy for Bluetooth enabled Adafruit boards to communicate with each other. The API is a simplified version of the work myself and a number of other volunteers did on the equivalent functionality for the BBC micro:bit."_

## News from around the web!

[![AD5245 Digital Potentiometer Breakout](../assets/11262019/112619AD5245.jpg)](https://hackaday.io/project/168605-ad5245-digital-potentiometer-breakout)

The AD5245 Digital Potentiometer breakout board is a simple implementation of the Analog Devices' I2C, 10K-ohm chip. The potentiometer sports 256 resistance steps and can work with a power source from 2.7v to 5.5v. The pins act similarly to a passive resistive potentiometer, but require that voltages placed on any of the three pins not exceed the power supply voltage or drop below ground potential. A CircuitPython library is included in the code folder of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/AD5245_Digital_Pot).

When we hear about how the teams from the Apple 1983 Mac efforts emphasized ease of use, simplicity ... it reminds us of many of the things we say and want to do with CircuitPython.

## What is the team up to this week?

Epic week, all reporting in!

**Bryan**

[![Bryan](../assets/11262019/112619bryan.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

This week on my bench I have, drumroll please.... two more motion sensors! The ICM-20649 and BMA456 have both made their way to me and I've successfully done initial tests with both. Next up I'll be working on drivers for both for CircuitPython and Arduino. Is this the end of Motion Sensor Season? Only time will tell...

**Dan**

We released CircuitPython 5.0.0-beta.0 Tuesday, along with the companion new adafruit_ble library! We're now updating all our CircuitPython BLE Learn Guides to match the new API in 5.0.0-beta.0

**Jeff**

This week I am improving how the CircuitPython software itself is built.  I fixed a problem which could have caused translations to be incomplete, and worked on compatibility with a newer version of the GCC compiler.  I also prototyped some performance improvements (15-30% increase running Python code according to one benchmark), but it is not yet compatible with all supported boards, so further work is required.

**Kattni**

This week's guide was the [PA1010D Mini GPS Module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4415) - a little all-in-one breakout that uses I2C and has STEMMA QT connectors on it. The [new guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mini-gps-pa1010d-module) has wiring diagrams, example code, and all the board information you need to get started with the Mini GPS Module. I started a guide for the [Circuit Playground Tri-Color E-Ink Gizmo](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4428) as well. The guide will include some easy-to-use CircuitPython code, making it super simple to get started adding an e-ink display to your Circuit Playground Express and Bluefruit projects. Speaking of Circuit Playground, I also did a complete refactor of the Circuit Playground Express library to now include the Circuit Playground Bluefruit! All of the Express code will continue to work the same, but you can now use the same concepts on the Circuit Playground Bluefruit. It still needs to be fully tested, but quick tests were successful. The Bluefruit module has all the same features as the Express module, plus a couple of bonus features, and the plan is to eventually add Bluetooth features as well!

**Lucian**

This week I worked on implementing the Neopixel module into the STM32 port, as well as addressing some timing bugs in the SPI and delay code. I also implemented the true random number generator into os.urandom. This coming week, I'll be working on adding new boards to the STM32 port, fixing some final issues with DisplayIO, and cleaning up the port structure to better handle the distinction between a board and an MCU package. 

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/11262019/112619melissa.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

This past week I got back from Hackaday SuperCon where I had a lot of fun and got to meet a lot of awesome people. After getting back, I caught up on emails and other messages and went on to closing some outstanding pull requests. I also worked with Kattni to get the E-Ink Gizmo guide by adding the E-Ink Gizmo to the Gizmo Library and writing a quick example. After that I added an example to the Adafruit EPD library and added E-Ink support to the Arduino ImageReader library. After the guide is available, I will be working on updating any guides for CharliePlexing with the IS31FL3731.

**Scott**

I had a great time last weekend chatting with folks at Supercon. Lots of interest in supporting CircuitPython on more hardware! Once back and caught up, I dove back into the new BLE library and dusted off the pairing support. Once paired, I got the Apple Notification Center Service up and running and then got BLE HID mostly working. This short week will be more BLE HID and also making an Apple Pie. :-)
