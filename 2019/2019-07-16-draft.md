Matt's team is using CircuitPython for on High Altitude Balloons! Their team HABET (High Altitude Balloon Experiments in Technology) is part of a program called Make 2 Innovate. Make To Innovate (M:2:I) is an exciting program in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University which engages students in hands-on projects to augment their understanding of engineering fundamentals - [Make to Innovate (M:2:I) Department of Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University](https://m2i.aere.iastate.edu/).

Why choose CircuitPython? Matt writes -

>_"We had been programming it in C up till this launch, but with myself graduating next semester along with the Computer Engineer on our team it we needed to find a way to allow for ease of maintenance. When I found you guys had libs for the radio and GPS we decided to try that out. The radio portion worked fantastic."_

## ALL ABOARD' CircuitPython.org updates - datum!

[![datum](../assets/07162019/71619datums.jpg)](https://jandjstudios.io/datum/)

The goal of the datum project is to make it easier for students and hobbyists to incorporate sensors into their projects by doing the heavy lifting of translating the language the sensors speak into a format that’s easy for humans to read and for machines to parse and process.

Towards that end each datum board emulates a serial port over a USB connection, presents the information and data stored on them in a JSON encapsulated packet, and processes URI style commands to change and retrieve their settings. The datum boards fill the gap between a LEGO® Mindstorms® sensor and a breakout board.

And now, the datum boards support CircuitPython! Check them all out on [CircuitPython.org!](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

[![CircuitPython.org](../assets/07162019/71619cporg01.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

By the numbers: CircuitPython has over [66+ boards supported](https://circuitpython.org/downloads), adding more each week & has [16+ SBC Linux boards supported](https://circuitpython.org/blinka), adding more each day, & over [164+ Libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries ), [adding more](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md) every week!

## TEARDOWN 2019: Supercharge Your Hardware Old and New with Circuit Python by Scott Shawcroft

[![TEARDOWN 2019](../assets/07162019/71619gameboy_guts.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xzREvFyL4co)

TEARDOWN 2019 video is now posted! Supercharge Your Hardware Old and New with Circuit Python by Scott Shawcroft - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/xzREvFyL4co) & [slides](https://github.com/tannewt/presentations/blob/master/teardown2019/presentation.md).

>_"CircuitPython makes programming hardware easier than ever by bringing the popular Python language to modern, inexpensive 32-bit microcontrollers. This doesn’t need to be limited to modern hardware though. By pairing a modern microcontroller running CircuitPython and a vintage computer, such as a GameBoy or Yamaha piano keyboard, you can unlock the unique characteristics of these vintage devices. In this talk, you’ll learn the basics of how CircuitPython makes coding easy, how it works under the hood, and how to extend CircuitPython with C. As an example, we’ll supercharge a Nintendo GameBoy with CircuitPython. By the end of the talk, you’ll be able to supercharge your own hardware project with CircuitPython."_

PyDev of the Week: Meg Ray on [Mouse vs Python](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2019/07/15/pydev-of-the-week-meg-ray/)

## Made with Mu

[![Mu](../assets/07162019/71619muep.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hN7uTcaHLM&feature=youtu.be&t=10232)

EuroPython Basel Friday, 12th 2019, Tools of the Trade: The Making of a Code Editor, Nicholas Tollervey - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hN7uTcaHLM&feature=youtu.be&t=10232) via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ntoll/status/1149965707700002816).

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy.
