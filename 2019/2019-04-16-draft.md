## Codecademy launches "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/04162019/41619codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.

Visit Codecademy to access the [Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter) course and Adafruit to purchase a [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333).

## CircuitPython snakes its way to Gamebuino! 

[![Gamebunio](../assets/04162019/41619gamebuino.png)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/04/09/circuitpython-snakes-its-way-to-gamebuino-thegamebuino-circuitpython-circuitpython-python/)

[Learn Python easily - Gamebuino](https://gamebuino.com/python) *"Learning to code in Python is soon possible with Gamebuino!"*

> Python is a easy to learn language, thanks to the readability of its code and the simplicity of use. It's an "interpreted" language, in other words you can execute it without compiling it. Not need to install another software, a simple text editor is enough! But simplicity does not mean a lack of possibilities! If it's one of the preferred languages to learn programming (the Académie Française has chosen the Python language for the new high school reform), it also allows the creation of advanced programs, and many big companies use it for their applications: YouTube, Spotify, and even NASA claim its use! ... If the final objective of Gamebuino (the creation of a game) is playful, we have put all our energy into making it a way for discovering the programming and becoming the ideal tool for learning Python.

## Resurrections from Celeste - GameBoys running CircuitPython

[![Resurrections from Celeste](../assets/04162019/41619celeste.jpg)](https://youtu.be/uruvgVJNg_g)

[Scott's](https://twitter.com/tannewt/status/1116046843815714816) GameBoy orchestra sounds great! MIDI is coming from the computer into the black GameBoy pocket. CircuitPython running in the cart processes it and then queues the sounds in the GameBoy. Any notes the first GameBoy can't play will be forwarded on to the next (blue) and then the DMG. Thanks to [Playful Piano](https://www.ninsheetmusic.org/forum/index.php?topic=9946) for the MIDI file. Thanks to [Lena Raine](https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/) for the wonderful Celeste soundtrack and to the Celeste crew for an amazing game. Support them by buying the game and soundtrack - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/uruvgVJNg_g).

LEGO is going full-on Python on hardware, this is the LEGO SPIKE Prime...

> _LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime is a powerful STEAM learning solution for middle school that combines LEGO bricks, coding language based on Scratch, and a programmable multi-port Hub to help every learner become a confident learner._

So! [According to this site,](https://virantha.com/2019/04/04/lego-spike-prime-compared/) the hub is running "MicroPython Operating System." !

The spec sheet came from [someone](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SPIKEcommunity/permalink/794262767618624/) who posted this on the [Facebook LEGO SPIKE page.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SPIKEcommunity/) And here is an [unboxing video](https://youtu.be/NTg5juB9xhA) & [parts list](https://www.newelementary.com/2019/04/lego-education-spike-prime-new-elements.html?fbclid=IwAR0D6Ir9Yr1Bf4htc5shSCuP50-l5Sx63Wzocp3s4JmujZUTQ2VKYjLZTpc).

> _The SPIKE Prime system appears to be using the same LPF2 (Lego® Power Functions 2.0) BluetoothLE communication system that they introduced with their PoweredUp and Boost robotics gear in the last few years. This new set introduces a new hub that now has 6 general purpose ports (up from 2 in their previous LPF2 systems), and an expanded set of peripherals such as sensors and motors. ... Even more exciting is that it says it's running an **embedded MicroPython OS**, so hopefully they will release the Python API at some point for downloadable programs. The processor inside is, however, only specc'ed at 100MHz._

PyCon AU has recently announced their [Call for Proposals](https://2019.pycon-au.org/speak/).

## Digi-Key + Adafruit @ PyCon!

[![PyCon](../assets/04162019/41619pycon.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

PyCon 2019 returns May 1–9, 2019 to Cleveland, OH – with talks, tutorials, sprints, and more! 

[![PyCon](../assets/04162019/41619pycdigikey.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

Big news! Digi-Key and Adafruit have teamed up for PyCon 2019 so every attendee (about 4,000!) will receive a [SPECIAL EDITION Circuit Playground Express](https://youtu.be/ZMx6qB-7z9U), running … CircuitPython.

[![PyCon](../assets/04162019/41619pyconboards.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

This effort is to get Python on hardware to the most folks out there, at the events that bring people together.

This is just one of many efforts we’re teaming up with Digi-Key to continue to fuel all the developers from beginners to pro, using Python on microcontrollers.

[![PyCon](../assets/04162019/41619team.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!

The PyCon 2019 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.

Scott will be leading a talk at the **Python Language Summit, History of CircuitPython**. The Python Language Summit is an event for the developers of Python implementations (CPython, PyPy, Jython, and so on) to share information, discuss our shared problems, and — hopefully — solve them - [pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit](https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/)

We will have a lot more updates, stay tuned to the [Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit), [Discord](http://adafru.it/discord), and more!
