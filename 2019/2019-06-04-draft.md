## 8/8/2019 is CircuitPython day

[![CircuitPython day](../assets/06042019/6419cpday.jpg)](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cod3wllmyninyn5/AADC6Z5EhEsG18X8WDRMEZuta?dl=0)

8/8/2019 is CircuitPython day this year, we're in the planning stages and will have live videos, celebrations, and more for this very snake friendly date! For now, we're starting to assemble the artwork in our public DropBox CircuitPython folder, check it out! - [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cod3wllmyninyn5/AADC6Z5EhEsG18X8WDRMEZuta?dl=0).

## Make a name (badge) for yourself, with CircuitPython

Here's a fantastic guide on making a name badge with a PyPortal, Mu, and CircuitPython. Les writes -

>_"I go to a fair few events in the year and each time delegates are given a sticker / badge to help everyone identify each other. But I wanted to make something a little more geeky / nerdy / techy! Creating a conference badge that will act as a digital business card. It will have our logo, a picture of us or a project, and then a QR code containing our contact details. Adafruit's PyPortal is an Internet of Things (IoT) device that has WiFi, a 70mm by 50mm 320x240 resolution touchscreen, light sensor, temperature sensor, Neopixel, microSD slot and a speaker.
Powered by an ATSAMD51J20 CPU and with wireless connectivity provided by an ESP32 this is a lot of power in a small board. Smaller than a Pi Zero W and Hyperpixel screen!"_

## Using Python on Windows 10

[![Using Python on Windows 10](../assets/06042019/6419pythonw10.png)](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-python-on-windows-10)

Getting Python on Windows is getting easier with recent Microsoft improvements!

It’s been widely known for many years that Windows is the only mainstream operating system that has not include a Python interpreter out of the box. For many users who are never going to need it, this helps reduce the size and improve the security of the operating system. But for those of us who do would like to use it, Python’s absence has been keenly felt.

With the May 2019 update to Windows 10, there are two methods to get Python 3.7 on your computer. There is a community release of Python 3.7 in the Microsoft Store. This will be the default choice for getting Python if you are looking for an easy install separate than those on the Internet.

Second, every install of Windows starting with the May 2019 update will include python and python3 commands that take you directly to the Python store page.

This tutorial will help you through these options - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-python-on-windows-10).

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/06042019/6419blinka.png)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **157**!

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/06042019/6419hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/06042019/6419codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
