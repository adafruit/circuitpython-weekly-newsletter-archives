Ada Lovelace Day (ALD) is October 8, 2019, it is an international celebration of the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). It aims to increase the profile of women in STEM and, in doing so, create new role models who will encourage more girls into STEM careers and support women already working in STEM - [findingada.com](https://findingada.com/).

## 10 Years of Programming Language Evolution, Python #1 spot

[![10 Years of Programming Language Evolution](../assets/10082019/10819python.jpg)](https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1335168#)

[A bit of repost](https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1335168#), but now with some more info and some Python on hardware...

>_"IEEE Spectrum released its annual ranking of program languages last month and many were surprised to see Python maintained its top spot. Python, a script-based language, has held the top spot in IEEE Spectrum’s ranking since 2017. That’s not the surprise. IEEE scores the languages using a weighted scale. Last year, Python had a score of 100, while C++ scored 99.7, Java scored 97.5, and C scored 96.7. This year, however, the landscape of languages changed. Python maintained its top spot with a score of 100, but Java came in second with a score of 96.3 — quite a fall. C came in third with 94.4, C++ slid all the way into fourth place with a score of 87.5, and statistical programming language R took the fifth spot with a score of 81.5. Spots 6-10 were taken by JavaScript, C#, MATLAB, Swift, and Google’s Go, in that order.... Python, Java, JavaScript, and C are versatile languages that keep them widely used. Speaking specifically to Python, there are many specialized libraries that support machine learning, deep learning (Theano), AI, and maker libraries for microcontrollers and tiny computers like Adafruit..."_

## Manufacturing Day 2019

[![MFGDay19](../assets/10082019/10819mfgday.png)](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%23MFGDay19)

Manufacturing Day 2019 was Oct 4th, 2019. [Here are our posts](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%23MFGDay19), and here are the [tagged Tweets #MFGDay19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MFGDay19?src=hashtag_click&f=live) that came in all day. [Earlier we posted](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/10/01/us-manufacturing-activity-drops-to-10-year-low-makerbusiness/) about some the national and internal trends along with how we're doing so far.

In the maker / electronics world, we’ve heard from friends and through the usual gossip some companies are down as much as 50% year over year to flat (same), to maybe 10% or so over last year. For Adafruit in September 2019 we ended up up +22.2% YoY, and up +3.1% more orders than last year at the same time. Another data point we wanted to add here: ADABOX is over 4,000+ subscribers, 1/3 of the original subscriber base has gotten every single one, over 172 have all 13 boxes out of the current 4k+ subs.

We’re 100% focused on getting new open-source hardware out, publishing open-source code, guides, videos, community efforts, and keeping popular items in stock and preparing for what may be an excellent holiday season. Thank you so much Adafruit team members, our community, our partners, and customers for being part of this adventure together with us. We remain VC-free, loan-free, open-source, woman-owned, and manufacturing in the USA. There will be challenges ahead for sure, we’re looking forward to navigating them together.

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/10082019/10819blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

## TEAM CIRCUITPYTHON !

What are we up to this week? Let's check in!

**Bryan**

_The LSM6DSOX is a sweet little accelerometer/gyro combo from ST. We've also got a "simple" 3-axis accelerometer from the fine folks at Bosch, the BMA456: Keeping with the motion sensing theme, I've got an updated STEMMA QT LSM303 board on my bench, testing it and working on the drivers. If you're good on motion sensing and instead are feeling a bit pressured to sense something in a port-able way, we've got the LPS33W ported pressure sensor coming up..._

_I updated the Adafruit Windows Drivers package for a bunch of new boards, and added placeholder definitions for other boards that are not yet announced or even thought of yet. The drivers package is not needed for Windows 10, but is still needed for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. There were issues with HID gamepad support in recent versions of CircuitPython, but these have now been fixed due to fixes in the TinyUSB code we use. Scott and I have talked several times about work Scott is doing to make the BLE API more general and easier to use. Watch for more improvements. I"m still working on bonding for BLE. There's a lot of code reorganization to do in preparation. As mentioned in our Python newsletter, I gave a talk at an MIT service organization reunion about my early personal experiences using computers, and then demonstrated CircuitPython - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Zk7WBOunlsg)._

**Kattni**

_This week included much guide work and complicated Fritzing object creation. I published the [new guide for the Adafruit STEMMA Speaker](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-stemma-speaker) which makes adding better audio to your project super simple. I added two new pages to the [Circuit Playground Bluefruit guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit): [Playground Color Picker](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit/playground-color-picker) and [Playground Bluetooth Plotter](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit/playground-bluetooth-plotter). The new pages show you how to use CircuitPython to use your mobile phone to control the NeoPixels on your CPB, and how to plot the temperature and light levels from the CPB to your mobile phone, both using the Adafruit Bluefruit LE Connect mobile application. I created Fritzing objects for the Circuit Playground TFT Gizmo, the STEMMA Speaker and the 2.9" eInk display breakout. I also successfully tested the FT232H USB to GPIO breakout in VMWare Fusion - so if you have reason to use it with that set up, you're in luck!_

_[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) started on 1 October, and I went through all the current library issues to identify issues that are Good First Issues. I found a few and created a number of new issues. We've already had a lot of activity! Thank you to everyone who has joined us on GitHub for the first time - welcome to our community!_

**Lucian**

_I've been working on supporting SPI on the STM32, and accompanying that, SPI Flash, which makes it much, much easier to load libraries onto the new Feather F405 and many other STM32 development boards. Now that that flash support is in place, there's some cleanup work to do for the STM32, along with remaining modules like Digital to Analog Conversion (DAC), UART Serial, and QSPI Flash, which is 4 times the SPIs, BONDed together, with a Q!_

**Melissa**

_I've been working on adding the TFT Gizmo to both CircuitPython and Arduino. With it has come its own set of challenges including adding more tests for the Circuit Playground Bluefruit and making sure all of the previous boards are still passing their respective tests. Adding bitmap loading to the ImageLoader library was also a lot of fun. Most of these updates are a consequence of working on writing a guide for the TFT Gizmo. Keep an eye out for it._

_I spent the week deep in _bleio and the BLE library. I've combined the Central and Peripheral classes into a Connection class to better share code and represent that connections are symmetric once established. I also moved scanning and advertising to Adapter to better represent the device discovery process. On Friday, I realized that the scanning should return an iterator rather than a list. This will allow for receiving results much faster than waiting for a timeout before being able to read the results. It will also allow for infinite scans which can be used to create smarter forever loops. For example, a forever loop could listen for color change broadcasts and update it's color perpetually. Put this code on a number of devices and you can orchestrate color animations across them all at once. This week, I'm debugging these changes, hope to get demos going and sending out the PRs for others to try._

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/10082019/10819helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
