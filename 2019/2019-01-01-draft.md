## Ringing in the New Year with Python on hardware and having a ball!

[![happy new year 01]({{ "/assets/01_1119ball.jpg	" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://learn.adafruit.com/new-years-eve-ball-drop/)

Since 1907, the Times Square Ball has been an annual spectacle that signals in the New Year. Commonly referred to as the ball drop, this 12-ft diameter glowing geodesic sphere descends from a flagpole at 11:59pm and takes 60 seconds. The ball itself has been redesigned over the years to reflect the latest in lighting technology.

This project is a ~1:20 scale replica of the Time Square Ball. It features a 180mm (7 inch) 3D printed geodesic sphere that is illuminated with NeoPixel LEDs. The ball is supported by a 2020 aluminum extrusion and suspended via a pulley and linear rail. A continuous servo turns and unwinds a rope tied to the ball allowing it to be lowered and raised. An on-board speaker at the base plays "Auld Lang Syne" synonymous as the New Years Eve Anthem. As the ball is lowered, a 10-sec countdown occurs followed by fireworks, crowd cheering and music playing ... all powered by CircuitPython - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/new-years-eve-ball-drop/)

## Updates on GitHub Repo

[![GitHub 03]({{ "/assets/03_1119github.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython)

We added the BLINKA graphics to the [CircuitPython GitHub Repo](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython) and the license badge. We added more "topics" as well: circuitpython, micropython, python, embedded, microcontroller, education, beginner, cpython, and python3. Check'em out and let us know if you have any suggestions to make our home on GitHub better. And we had our main account Adafruit, [verified](https://help.github.com/articles/verifying-your-organization-s-domain/) so it's clear that it's from Adafruit.

## CircuitPython in 2019

[![circuitpython 2019 04]({{ "/assets/04_1119codec.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/17/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2019-circuitpython2019-circuitpython/)

As 2018 comes to a close we like to reflect on how the year went and set goals for 2019. In the last two years ([2017](https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/01/09/welcome-to-the-adafruit-circuitpython-beta/), [2018](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/01/29/circuitpython-in-2018/)) this has been a blog post by Scott (aka tannewt). For 2019, we’d like to do it a bit differently. This time we’d like everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the Internet.

We’ll read these over the holidays and into the first half of January. After the January 14th CircuitPython weekly we’ll draft an overarching vision post for CircuitPython in 2019 and discuss it in the following meeting.

See [the blog post for more details](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/17/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2019-circuitpython2019-circuitpython/).

## New Learn Guides!

[NeoTrellis Light Painting](https://learn.adafruit.com/neotrellis-light-painting) from [Mike Barela](https://learn.adafruit.com/users/MikeBarela)

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Check back next week for more updated guides on using CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **124**!

**New Libraries!**

Here's this week's new CircuitPython libraries:

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/1119hello.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
