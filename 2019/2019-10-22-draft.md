A fun and interesting thing I did this week was prototyping the tester circuit and writing the tester code for the mpu6050 gyro and accelerometer. Each individual sensor breakout, development board, pi hat or bonnet, fancy tft display, featherwing, or other electronic dodad that we manufacture is tested before it gets sent out. To do this, our eagle-eyed staff deploy a phalanx of test jigs to verify each item coming off the assembly line to make sure it's up to snuff.

**Dan**

I'm still working on the storage infrastructure needed for BLE bonding. The actual bonding code is fairly simple; it's prepping for it that's been more complicated. I've removed unused code from the CircuitPython for chips and boards that are supported in MicroPython but that we don't support. This reduces confusion about what we do support, and makes it easier to search the code base without encountering irrelevant files.

**Kattni**

This week has been more Raspberry Python updates. I've been working through updating more guides with CircuitPython and Python on Linux usage. As I update, I have been testing breakouts and more on Raspberry Pi; this week I tested MAX31856, ADXL345 and Pixie LEDs. We recently saw the addition of a basic driver for the MCP9600 thermocouple amplifier. I spent the second half of the week working on implementing the rest of the features available for that chip, including alert configuration. You'll be able to use CircuitPython and Python on Linux to set up four separate alerts on the chip. Once documented and reviewed, the driver will be available in the CircuitPython library bundle and on PyPI. Keep an eye out that and more updated guides!

**Lucian**

This week I've been working on the internals of UART, adjusting the tools ST provides to be more tolerant of unexpected data and soft reboots. It's been unpleasantly resilient, due to bugs that impede debugger use, but should be wrapped up soon. Next I'll be working on implementing PWM, which should enable more LED related library use, and cleanup for the port as a whole.

**Melissa**

Last week I finished up updating all of the color TFT breakout guides with a new Python section so that they can be used in the User Space on the Raspberry Pi. The pages are mirrored to all of the guides, so you can check them out [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/2-2-tft-display/python-wiring-and-setup) and [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/2-2-tft-display/python-usage). This week I've been heads down in eInk Displays. I've been working on updating guides for using eInk displays with displayio instead of the EPD library. I've also been working on some demo code for the Raspberry Pi.

**Scott**

Last week I continued my BLE saga by getting Connections working again after merging the Central and Peripheral roles together. The big thing here is that the services themselves are now defined once and used for both sides of the connection. This will make it easier to establish and maintain services and characteristics.
