## Design News - 2 game-changing trends that will define embedded systems in the 2020s

Yep, [one of them is Python](https://www.designnews.com/electronics-test/2-game-changing-trends-will-define-embedded-systems-2020s/21213961262023)...

>_" the compute power available in microcontrollers has grown to the point where a stripped-down version of a Python kernel can be ran on a microcontroller that costs only a few dollars. Second, there are already popular open source ports for Python."_

The other is Machine learning at the edge.

## What is the team working on?

A LOT THIS WEEK!

This past week has seen me "ship" the CircuitPython and Arduino drivers I wrote for the LSM6DSOX and ICM20649, as well as publishing the MLX90640 driver written by ladyada. All three can be found in the latest [CircuitPython bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) and soon in the Arduino Library Manager as well. I then got to work testing and writing drivers for the upcoming breakout board for the Microchip MCP4728 quad 12-bit I2C DAC. This little gem gives you 4 separate DACs that you can use to control voltages being used for...whatever you want! Furthermore, you can save the settings for each channel to an internal EEPROM so that it will default to whichever voltages you want when first powered on.

Last week I finished a large refactoring of how regions are specified in internal flash memory in CircuitPython. The changes add reasonable defaults and centralize where the regions are specified. This simplifies how new boards are defined. I fixed an issue with internal flash filesystems on nRF chips. In addition several of us worked together quickly to fix issues caused by moving our compiler toolchain to gcc 9. Coming up (I know I keep mentioning this, but this time it's for real): bonding for BLE, which remembers pairing information.

Do you miss the days of standalone mp3 players like Zune and iPod?  If I get my way, those days are coming back. Now that MP3 decoding is in Circuit Python 5.0 beta 1, it's time to do something useful and fun with it.  Here's a picture of my "work in progress" music player in CircuitPython on a PyGamer, with MP3 files on a micro SD card.  Right now I'm working on the file picker.  Ultimately, it will have a basic set of functions such as play/pause/stop, next/previous track, etc. The track titles are from They Might Be Giants' album Here Comes Science.  If you don't know who they are, [check them out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIoIakk2L10) the link goes to official youtube for the title track.  They have music for kids, adults, and adults who are actually kids inside.

This week, among other things, I published the [Circuit Playground Bluefruit NeoPixel Animation and Color Remote Control](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-bluefruit-neopixel-animation-and-color-remote-control) guide. This project was so much fun. It uses two Circuit Playground Bluefruits and a couple of NeoPixel strips to make a festive Bluetooth controlled wreath. One CPB acts as the NeoPixel Animator and the other as the Remote Control. The Remote Control is used to change LED colors and animations on the Animator wirelessly over Bluetooth! In the process of writing this guide, we updated the [Adafruit CircuitPython LED Animation](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_LED_Animation) library to have a set of animations available in CircuitPython. Now if you want to create an LED sparkle, comet, and more, you can use this library and let it do all the hard work for you. There are still more improvements and animations being added, so keep an eye on that!

**Melissa**  
This last week I started by updating the IS31FL3731 CharliePlex Display guide by adding a page that explains the examples. One of these examples is an Animated GIF Player. You can check out that [guide page here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-charlieplex-bonnet/python-examples). I also worked on a collaboration project with John Park and we designed a project around the Circuit Playground Bluefruit and TFT Gizmo to interact with the iPhone and Apple's Notification Center Service to display bitmaps of the notifications along with automatic screen dimming to help out with battery conservation. This was based on some examples that were originally written by Scott. After that I wrote an example for the Arduino ImageReader library to demonstrate how to load bitmaps onto E-Ink Breakouts and did some minor guide updates to direct the user to use that example. You can check that out this guide page [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-eink-display-breakouts/drawing-bitmaps).  Next up, I updated the PyBadger library to work better with external fonts by changing the calculations of where to display the correct height of the labels. I also made it so using external fonts is as easy as passing in the location of the font file. Next week I'll be porting the animated GIF player over to some PiTFT displays and starting on the HT16K33 Segmented and Matrix LED Driver guide updates.

**Scott**  
Last week I released CircuitPython 5.0.0 Beta 1 and followed up with a couple bug fixes. They will be released with Beta 2 this week. In the meantime, I've focused on adding support for the BLE Apple Media Service which allows you to see the current playing track and control the media player. It is the first packet based BLE protocol we've supported so I'm adding a PacketBuffer to _bleio. It should also allow us to do BLE MIDI. Hopefully, I'll have a demo of that this week as well.

## Upcoming events!
