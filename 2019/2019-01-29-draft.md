## CircuitPython in 2019 - In your words

[![CircuitPython in 2019]({{ "/assets/12919circpy2019.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/28/circuitpython-in-2019/)

2019 is starting with us as a CircuitPython community coming together to discuss the future of CircuitPython. Undoubtedly, the future is bright but what will it be exactly? While none of us can tell the future, each of us posted our individual thoughts earlier this year. (See the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%23circuitpython2019) for each post.) Yesterday, we posted [the aggregation of these ideas](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/28/circuitpython-in-2019/) to lay out our focus for CircuitPython in 2019.

## Micropython 1.10 Release – Vast improvements to native emitter, new nrf port, unified documentation

[![Micropython 1.10]({{ "/assets/12919mp01.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.10)

In this release there are a wide range of improvements and additions to both the core and the ports. In the core the main improvement was to the native emitter to have much more comprehensive support for general Python features, such as generators and complex exception handling, and the generated machine code is smaller and retains its efficiency. Elsewhere, fuzzy testing was used to find and eliminate some corner-case bugs, user classes were optimised when they don’t use special accessors, underscores in numeric literals are now supported (PEP515), and the uio.IOBase class was added to allow user defined streams. More details at [GitHub](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.10), [forum post](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?t=5868&p=33586#p33586), [changelog](http://micropython.org/resources/micropython-ChangeLog.txt), and [download](https://micropython.org/download/).

## Python history - The Python programming language was originally developed for the Amoeba operating system

[![Amoeba]({{ "/assets/12919amoeba.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/21/the-python-programming-language-was-originally-developed-for-the-amoeba-operating-system/)

From our [dive in to Python history](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/21/the-python-programming-language-was-originally-developed-for-the-amoeba-operating-system/)! The Amoeba (operating system) – [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba_(operating_system)). *"Amoeba is a distributed operating system developed by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and others at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The aim of the Amoeba project was to build a timesharing system that makes an entire network of computers appear to the user as a single machine. Development at the Vrije Universiteit was stopped: the source code of the latest version (5.3) was last modified on 30 July 1996. The Python programming language was originally developed for this platform."*

**The Amoeba Distributed Operating System**

[![The Zoo]({{ "/assets/12919zoo.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="256px"}](https://www.cs.vu.nl/pub/amoeba/)

*"Amoeba is a powerful microkernel-based system that turns a collection of workstations or single-board computers into a transparent distributed system. It has been in use in academia, industry, and government for about 5 years. It runs on the SPARC (Sun4c and Sun4m), the 386/486, 68030, and Sun 3/50 and Sun 3/60.*

*At the Vrije Universiteit, Amoeba runs on a collection of 80 single-board SPARC computers connected by an Ethernet, forming a powerful processor pool. This equipment is pictured below. It is used for research in distributed and parallel operating systems, runtime systems, languages, and applications."*

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/12919hello.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
