## Python snakes its way to eInk displays!

[![eink]({{ "/assets/1819eink01.JPG" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://youtu.be/cZl-pTRokgw)

[![eink]({{ "/assets/1819eink02.JPG" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://youtu.be/cZl-pTRokgw)

We're working on these lovely eInk breakouts come in multiple sizes and have an SRAM buffer, so you don't have to have lots of free memory to use them. We like the red/black/white tri-color displays for that vivid red highlighting! They look great even in bright daylight - [Video](https://youtu.be/cZl-pTRokgw) & [here's the JSON](https://www.adafruit.com/api/quotes.php?random=1) of the [quotes](https://www.adafruit.com/quotes) from Adafruit to play around with too.

## Biggest board to support CircuitPython is shipping!

[![The Grand Central]({{ "/assets/1819gchand.JPG" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4064)

It's here! The Grand Central. To start off our ATSAMD51 journey we are going large with the Mega shape and pinout you know and love. The front half has the same shape and pinout as our Metro's, so it is compatible with all our shields. 

[![The Grand Central]({{ "/assets/1819gcladyada.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4064)

It's got analog pins where you expect, and SPI/UART/I2C hardware support in the same spot as the Metro 328 and M0. 

[![The Grand Central]({{ "/assets/1819tester.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4064)

It's powered with an ATSAMD51P20: Cortex M4 core running at 120 MHz, Hardware DSP and floating point support, 1MB flash, 256 KB RAM, 32-bit, 3.3V logic and power, 70 GPIO pins in total, Dual 1 MSPS DAC (A0 and A1), Dual 1 MSPS ADC (15 analog pins), 8 x hardware SERCOM (can be I2C, SPI or UART), 22 x PWM outputs, Stereo I2S input/output with MCK pin, 12-bit Parallel capture controller (for camera/video in), Built in crypto engines with AES (256 bit), true RNG, Pubkey controller - [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4064).

## Modern Turtle Graphics, the descendants of LOGO in Python

[![turtle]({{ "/assets/1819turtlestar.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/04/modern-turtle-graphics-the-descendants-of-logo-in-python-python-logo-thepsf/)

Some of the most popular Adafruit blog posts last year, including the #1 post, revolved around LOGO, the original “turtle” graphics developed in the 1960’s for learning which was shipped on nearly all classic computing platforms since.

The popularity is due to the simplicity – if you can learn an etch-a-sketch, you can learn turtle graphics. Once you learn, then you can do things that etch-a-sketch only dreams of, more like spirograph!

Python is the fastest growing computer language today, with school and hobbyist adoptions growing year over year.

Can Python do turtle graphics ala LOGO? Yes it can! Here are some ways you can do turtle graphics in a Python environment - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/04/modern-turtle-graphics-the-descendants-of-logo-in-python-python-logo-thepsf/).

## CircuitPython in 2019

[![2019]({{ "/assets/1819cpcc.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/17/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2019-circuitpython2019-circuitpython/)

As 2018 comes to a close we like to reflect on how the year went and set goals for 2019. In the last two years ([2017](https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/01/09/welcome-to-the-adafruit-circuitpython-beta/), [2018](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/01/29/circuitpython-in-2018/)) this has been a blog post by Scott (aka tannewt). For 2019, we’d like to do it a bit differently. This time we’d like everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the Internet.

We’ll read these over the holidays and into the first half of January. After the January 14th CircuitPython weekly we’ll draft an overarching vision post for CircuitPython in 2019 and discuss it in the following meeting.

See [the blog post for more details](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/17/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2019-circuitpython2019-circuitpython/).

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/1819hello.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
