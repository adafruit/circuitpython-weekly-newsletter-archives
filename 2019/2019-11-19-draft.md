It’s beginning to look like Ada-BOX-mas  
Everywhere you go  
Let all your ideas flow, for projects you want to show  
With buttons and LEDs all aglow  

It’s beginning to look like Ada-BOX-mas  
Everything is grand  
But the nicest thing on the shelf, is something you made yourself  
With your own hands  

A Circuit Playground with a speaker for sound  
Is the wish of Barney and Ben  
A Raspberry Pi with some LCD eyes  
Is the hope of Janice and Jen  
And friends at the hackerspace can’t wait to 3D print again  

It’s beginning to look like Ada-BOX-mas  
Everywhere you go  
So grab a featherwing, let the piezo buzzer ring  
And prototype a board for sensing snow  

It’s beginning to look like Ada-BOX-mas  
Time for oscilloscopes  
Get your projects all debugged, then cozy up nice and snug  
With some nice cocoa  

## Hackaday SuperCon recap!

[![SuperCon](../assets/11192019/111919teamsuper.jpg)](https://twitter.com/hashtag/supercon?src=hashtag_click&f=live)

There's a lot to unpack, literally! Some of the team was at SuperCon, there were CircuitPython powered badges for all, and more!

[![Easy](../assets/11192019/111919easy.jpg)](https://twitter.com/InstantArcade/status/1196529366668173312)

No documentation needed!

**Edge Badge hackers!**

[![RobotGrrl](../assets/11192019/111919robog01.jpg)](https://www.robotmissions.org)

[![RobotGrrl](../assets/11192019/111919robog02.jpg)](https://www.robotmissions.org)

Erin Kennedy/ Erin RobotGrrl. Erin runs [Robot Missions](https://www.robotmissions.org), a social enterprise in Ontario, Canada.

Erin hacked her badge into an autonomous tree planting robot! When started, it searches the area for a region with extra light, and then prompts the robot tender to confirm that it should drop the seedling and listens for “Yes” or “No” voice commands! - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/PHB-FD5RlGQ).

From Erin: The badge was a “collab between me, [Sara Petkus](https://twitter.com/spetku), and [Evan](https://twitter.com/EdjeElectronics).

>_“ The idea behind the robot was to make a simple example of how tech can be used to help our environment. There's a movement happening right now called Team Trees, and so to plant 20 million trees or more, we will need some help from automation! Aerial and ground based robot swarms can help!"_

 * It used the Adafruit Tensorflow Library
 * Autonomous mode searched for light using the on board light sensor
 * Once light was above a certain threshold, it would wait to hear the yes / no speech recognition example
 * If yes, then it would plant a (figurative) tree sapling
 * Buttons were used to test movement
 * Used a simple two channel motor driver and two servos  - luckily there were just enough pins for these!
 * Power input was the same battery and voltage regulator setup with Bowie: 2 cell lipo in, with two regulators for DC motors and servos
 * DC motors were metal gear motors. Each side had independent control
 * Lots of duct tape was used
 * The robot body was a cereal box
 * The tree sapling container was the top of the poster tube
 * Reinforcements were plastic forks and knives for the suspension
 * Further testing will be needed to get the speech recognition to work properly and further testing will be needed for retraining the model for custom words. But, this was a really fun and awesome start!! Pretty cool what possibilities are possible with ai at the edge
 * It's also cool because Bowie the shoreline cleanup robot uses Tensorflow on a Pi. So the more effort that goes into making these run with less power and more speed will help!!
 * Thanks Adafruit for the badge at Supercon! And the help IRL and Discord! “

The latest Robot Missions video - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/a46Ll46IuM4) and about their work.

>_“By empowering communities to embark on missions aimed at helping our planet using robots, we harness the power of citizen science to respond locally to these global challenges. At the heart of Robot Missions are Field Tests, bringing together a group of volunteers spanning technology, environmental, and educational communities. At the park, we operate the robot and pick up trash, with the public joining in too. For several, this is their introductory experience to robotics.”_

Alex Whittemore - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexwhittemore) and [site](https://www.alexwhittemore.com/). Alex is a contractor working for the Jet Propulsion Lab just outside of Pasadena. He hacked his badge to record environmental CO2 levels and graph the data on the Edge Badge’s screen by connecting a CO2 sensor to the badge’s grove-compatible STEMMA port. 

Additionally he attached a laser to the edge badge’s speaker pin and used it to inject voice commands to a google home’s microphone from a distance, allowing him to hijack an unsuspecting google home base station.

[![Tom](../assets/11192019/111919tom02.jpg)](https://github.com/tomacorp/edgemicscope)

[Tom A](https://twitter.com/tomacorp). Tom rewired the Edge Badge’s PDM mic to the I2S port on the SAMD51, allowing it to process streaming data. He used this and some clever software to turn the Edge Badge into an “audio oscilloscope” of sorts:

A blurb from Tom:

>_“I have been using Python for a few years and tried CircuitPython for the first time on Friday. With a little help from @no1089, I was up to speed by the end of the day, with new microphone connections made to the I2S port, to match the documentation of the existing AdaFruit digital MEMS microphone. After probing the signals, clock and data looked good, and the example microphone code got me started. Combining this with the display code for the EDGE badge allowed me to show the microphone output versus time. This is the same display that you can see by attaching a microphone to an oscilloscope.” ... “An early version of the code is on [Github](https://github.com/tomacorp/edgemicscope) This was coded on Saturday night to the beat of loud techno during a Superconference 2019 party, so forgive my cut-and-paste programming! I already have better code and will release it Real Soon Now.”_

[Chris](https://twitter.com/no1089) who helped Tom.

[![Thomas](../assets/11192019/111919laser.jpg)](https://github.com/Tschucker/circuitpython_edgebadge_audio_spectrum_waterfall_display)

[Thomas Schucker](https://twitter.com/tdsepsilon) [Github Repo](https://github.com/Tschucker/circuitpython_edgebadge_audio_spectrum_waterfall_display) - Tom made his Edge Badge into an “Audio spectrum display for the Adafruit edge badge, using a custom FFT in circuit python!

The Adafruit edge badge needs to have pin D12 jumpered to D6, and pin TX jumpered to D5 in order for the PDM library to access the microphone on the board.”

## Take Flight with Feather - Hackaday and Digi-Key

[![Take Flight with Feather](../assets/11192019/111919takeflight.png)](https://hackaday.io/contest/168107-take-flight-with-feather)

The Adafruit Feather is the latest platform for microcontroller development, and companies like Particle, Sparkfun, and Seeed Studios are producing Feather-compatible devices for development and prototyping. Now it’s your turn. Design a board to fit in the Feather ecosystem and we’ll manufacture it. The best project in the Take Flight With Feather contest will be sent off to pick and place machines and head straight to the Digi-Key warehouse!

To get started, take a look at the current [Feather ecosystem](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/community-feathers-wings) and get acquainted with the [GitHub repo filled with examples and tutorials](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-feather).

For the Take Flight With Feather contest, we’re looking for the cool, the useful, the insane, and the practical. Most of all, we’re looking for manufacturability. Electron savant Lady Ada will be judging each board on the basis of manufacturability, with the best board moving on to the assembly line where it will be stocked at Digi-Key.

**What’s a good design? We’re looking for submissions in the following categories:**

*   The Weirdest Feather — What’s the most ridiculous expansion board you can come up with?
*   You’ll Cut Yourself On That Edge — We’re surrounded with bleeding-edge tech, what’s the coolest use of new technology?
*   Retro Feather — Old tech lives on, but can you design a Feather to interact with it? Is it even possible to build a vampire Ethernet tap or an old acoustically-coupled modem?
*   Assistive Tech — Build a Feather to help others. Use technology to improve lives.
*   Wireless Feather — Add a new wireless technology to the Feather ecosystem.

The winning entry overall will be chosen for manufacturability, and will win a small manufacturing run of 100 boards or less and be stocked at Digi-Key. The number of boards in the manufacturing run will be determined by the winning design. Note: Because of the small run initially, there will be no profit or margin for the first few boards. If the board is well accepted and a larger run is planned, then a longer term business model will be addressed. The 5 winners in the 5 categories above will receive $100 Tindie gift certificates. To get started, start a project on [hackaday.io](http://hackaday.io) and upload your project. Contest runs noon November 1 to noon December 31st. All times are in Pacific Standard Time.

**Entries so far!**

There are over 25+ entries so far, from what we were told this contest has had the most entries, the fastest, for hackaday.io contests! Here they are in order of [how they are listed on the hackaday.io contest site](https://hackaday.io/submissions/take-flight-with-feather/list).

## Logitech Bundles Assistive Technology Switches

[![Logtech](../assets/11192019/111919atml.jpg)](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gamepads/adaptive-gaming-kit-accessories.html)

Logitech Gaming, working with AbleGamers and other groups just released the Logitech G Kit for the XBox Adaptive controller. The kit includes 10 standard AT switches plus two variable input Triggers, two mounting boards and accessories for about $100 - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/DnHOFfLCpig).

Bill Binko of ATMakers.org _“That’s Frikkin Huge! To buy that kit from traditional AT vendors would cost over $600 just for the switches. This is what happens when consumer electronics companies turn their eye on the AT space. There is an entire market waiting for devices they can use, and we should all be celebrating this amazing progress.”_

Although these switches were designed to be used with the Xbox Adaptive Controller, they have standard AT 1/8″ jacks that can be used on a variety of assistive technology devices.

_“Congrats first to Logitech G and AbleGamers for making this great kit, but also to Microsoft for making the XAC use standard AT interfaces. That makes all of these switches useful in things OTHER than the XAC such as speech generating devices, power chairs, adapted toys and more. Great Job!”,_ Bill said.

Also there is now a Rev D of the silicon which does fix some of the other errata. They talk about EFP vs non-EFP versions: I haven't been able to figure out what "EFP" is.

## Coming soon

[![Stemma](../assets/11192019/MCP2221.png)](https://www.adafruit.com/stemma)

First up, the MCP2221 is a really low cost USB->GPIO adapter that has ADC/DAC/GPIO/I2C/UART support. The FT232H is more powerful in some ways, but we like the simplicity and cheap BoM of this chip. We thought it could make a great USB C -> I2C adapter with GPIO breakouts. 

[![Stemma](../assets/11192019/BNO080.png)](https://www.adafruit.com/stemma)

Next some breakouts! The BNO080 is a bosch 9-DoF with an ATSAMD20, Hillcrest added IMU code so you can use it for absolute-orientation uses without needing AHRS or Madgwick codewrangling. Now in STEMMA QT format! Its a little larger than most STEMMA's cause we have full level shifting circuitry for all the pins. 

[![Stemma](../assets/11192019/LSM9DS1.png)](https://www.adafruit.com/stemma)

The LSM9DS1 is a 9-DoF without a co-procesor, but its pretty cheap! We've already got a breakout for this chip but we'd like to  STEMMAfy it so it can be used in tethered applications a lot eaiser.

[![Stemma](../assets/11192019/BH1750.png)](https://www.adafruit.com/stemma)

The BH1750 and friends are common low-cost light/lux sensors.

[![Stemma](../assets/11192019/LIS3xx.png)](https://www.adafruit.com/stemma)

LIS3xx breakout - we'll be able to use this layout to STEMMify the LIS3DH breakout we have, and also support the higher-g LIS331 and super-high-g  H3LIS331.

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/11192019/111919blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **196**!

## What is the team up to this week?

Let's find out!

**Bryan**

[![Bryan](../assets/11192019/111919bryanw.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

This week I've been working on the CircuitPython and Arduino drivers for the LSM6DSOX, a new IMU from ST with lots of cool built in features, like a pedometer mode! We haven't added that one just yet but by all means submit a PR ;).

I also brought up the ST ISM330DHCX which is a very similar sensor. Similar enough to use the same PCB. With any luck this one will be out in record time.

I've also just returned from the Hackaday Superconference where I had an incredible time meeting with, hacking next to, and being inspired by some of the most creative and kind people I've ever met. Sophi, Mike, Elliot, and the rest of the folks behind the  SuperCon deserve all the kudos and more for organizing and running a con that fosters an amazing community of people. I've never met so many nice, inspiring, engaging, and creative people, and I've never made so many new friends in such a short amount of time. SuperCon has set the high water mark for conferences of any sort, both in content and community.

As if that wasn't enough, SuperCon 2019 raised the bar by lightyears for how much Open Source goodness can be packaged in a single badge. It deserves it's own blog post or more, but in short Jeroen/Sprite_TM and co built an FPGA based badge running a custom gateware that included among other things two RISC-V processors, a PIC mcu, and several peripherals including a synth engine. Attendees could hack on it from the hardware to the firmare/C level, all the way down to changing the Verilog that defined the hardware structure within the FPGA.
                                            
Truly amazing.

This week I worked on wrapping up the final edits of UART, Displayio, and cleanup PRs for the stm32 port, including us_delay, board defaults, and DAC auto shutoff. This week I'll be adding the Neopixel module and creating the definitions number of new boards, such as the Meowbit, the PybNano, and a 411 "Blackpill" style board. I'll also be continuing cleanup tasks like improving the microcontroller module, revising the stm32 clock system, and fixing old missing features like os.random.

Ever wish you had your own echolocation? Now you can with an ultrasonic distance sensor! This week, I created a new [Ultrasonic Sonar Distance Sensors](https://learn.adafruit.com/ultrasonic-sonar-distance-sensors/) guide for the HC-SR04 and US100. Learn how to wire them up, install the necessary libraries, and run code to read the distance values from the sensors using CircuitPython. The US-100 also works with Linux and Python using the Adafruit Blinka library. Next up is a new guide for the new [Mini GPS module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4415) which works with I2C and UART, and includes STEMMA QT connectors to make it super simple to get started. In the meantime, I'm working on wrapping up the Python updates to any CircuitPython guides still needing them. Keep an eye on the Adafruit Blog and the Python on Microcontrollers newsletter for any new and updated guides!

I finished updating the 1.5” and 2.4”Monochrome OLED guide, the 2.3” Monochrome OLED Guide, and the 2.7” Monochrome OLED Guide by adding CircuitPython and Python sections. I also wrote the SSD1305 Displayio Driver, fixed the SSD1305 Framebuf driver. You can check out the guides at here:

 * [1.5" & 2.4" Monochrome 128x64 OLED Display Module](https://learn.adafruit.com/1-5-and-2-4-monochrome-128x64-oled-display-module).
 * [2.3" Monochrome 128x32 OLED Display Module](https://learn.adafruit.com/2-3-monochrome-128x32-oled-display-module).
 * [2.7" Monochrome 128x64 OLED Display Module](https://learn.adafruit.com/2-7-monochrome-128x64-oled-display-module).

I also wrote a displayio driver for the SSD1305 monochrome OLED displays. I made some improvements to the Gizmo Helper library examples and added both of these libraries to the bundle.

I’m going through the Drivers and Learn Guide code and updating it so that everything works with the new CircuitPython 5.0 as well as the current CircuitPython 4.1.
