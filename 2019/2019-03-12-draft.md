[During the LIVE Microchip Livestream event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yxtECtDrCA) on March 12, 2019 at 9am PT / 12pm ET, which is almost right now if you're just receving this newsletter now. Microchip will be giving away [5 Adafruit PyPortals](https://www.adafruit.com/pyportal) for IoT Design week! You can also register [here](https://mchp.us/2H369c2) for other prizes if you can’t tune in to the live show.

## CircuitPython 4.0.0 Beta 3 released!

The CircuitPython 4.0.0 Beta 3 release is available here: [https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpyth ... 0.0-beta.3](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/4.0.0-beta.3). This is a beta build of 4.0.0. Beta 3 includes many `displayio` improvements, `bleio` fixes, adds `rotaryio` support to nRF and adds `frequencyio` to SAMD. There are still [issues to fix before stable](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%224.0.0+-+Bluetooth%22) and the new APIs may evolve a bit more but it's getting close! Please help test it.

Find the latest binaries for your board on [the new website](https://circuitpython.org/downloads) and check GitHub for [the full details](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/4.0.0-beta.3).

The latest [MicroPython newsletter is here](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=6077) and it has updates as well as details on the upcoming pyboard-D series!

> _A lot of effort has been spent over the past months verifying the stability of the system and making sure it is suitable for robust embedded systems. The new pyboard uses a Cortex-M7 which is a high-performance CPU and we needed to understand the full implications of the advanced features of this CPU and their interaction with the rest of the microcontroller system. We did see some issues when using the external QSPI flash in memory-mapped mode which have now been resolved._

SparkFun released a [ESP32 WROOM board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14689) that is Adafruit FEATHER compatible. At the core of this module is the ESP32-D0WDQ6 chip which is designed to be both scalable and adaptive. To make the Thing Plus even easier to use, they moved a few pins around to make the board Feather compatible. Alasdair Allan on the hackster.io blog writes *"With Arduino in the process of abandoning their “classic” form factor that has for some years now been the standard, in favour of something more modern, the community seems instead to be adopting Adafruit’s Feather as the next standard. Nothing suggests that more than the arrival of a SparkFun Feather board."* - [hackster.io](https://blog.hackster.io/a-sparkfun-feather-board-65cddf5b7a98)

## PyPoral - Internet of Gremlin Things

Don't get them wet, don't put them near light, especially sunlight, and do not feed them after midnight, no matter how much they beg. Seems like a simple set of rules for keeping a pet mogwai from turning in to a green monster gremlin, yet - it seems to happen every single time.

> _"You do with Mogwai what your society has done with all of nature's gifts! You do not understand! You are not ready"_ - Mr. Wing (Grandfather)

We're ready now. With this IoT Wi-Fi alarm clock ([video](https://youtu.be/LqX7qU7KLGA)), the mogwais will not be able to sneak around and change the clock, it uses [adafruit.io](http://adafruit.io) and a time server. The device gets online, gets the time and then has 2 alarms: midnight, and lets you know DO NOT FEED, then at 8am, back to being able to feed the mogwai.

Workin' on a future breakout - this one is an ESP32 breakout board for use with CircuitPython boards as a co-processor or maybe if you want something compact and no USB-serial converter. We are using a Teensy 3.6 with SD card to write the test firmware over serial using the ROM bootloader, run some tests, and then burn the final firmware. It's slower than command line, but easier to run two at a time, so ... think this is going to work out! - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4u1dn3UzKxk).

PyCon 2019 returns May 1–9, 2019 to Cleveland, OH – with talks, tutorials, sprints, and more! 

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/31219pyconDigi-Key.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

Big news! Digi-Key and Adafruit have teamed up for PyCon 2019 so every attendee (about 4,000!) will receive a [SPECIAL EDITION Circuit Playground Express](https://youtu.be/ZMx6qB-7z9U), running … CircuitPython.

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/31219pyconboards.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

This effort is to get Python on hardware to the most folks out there, at the events that bring people together.

This is just one of many efforts we’re teaming up with Digi-Key to continue to fuel all the developers from beginners to pro, using Python on microcontrollers.

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/31219team.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!

The PyCon 2019 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.

We will have a lot more updates, stay tuned to the [Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit), [Discord](http://adafru.it/discord), and more!

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/31219hello.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).

We emailed the 2,000,000th customer and here is what they had to say...

> _I love adafruit, and point out to my daughters that I order cool stuff from adafruit because it's a woman owned business,  and Limor demonstrably shows that its OK to be in tech, be yourself (and have cool hair), although I'm partial to mohawks. Lol. You guys are freakin' awesome! I purchased items for my tortoise tracker (yes... really... he escaped and managed to scuttle a mile away or so, while I was like 3d printing,  LoRa and GPS for the win!). The fact that I happened to be the lucky customer makes it just that much more awesome. Thank you so much, and thank you for being an amazing company and a true inspiration - Old dude with a mohawk._
