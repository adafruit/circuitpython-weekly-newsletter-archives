## Women in Open source award, please vote!

[![Ladyada]({{ "/assets/21219redhat.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/women-in-open-source)

Our Ladyada (Limor Fried) was nominated for Red Hat's Women in Open Source Award! CircuitPython is open-source hardware, and software, and always will be! Please vote for her! Visit -  [https://www.redhat.com/en/about/women-in-open-source](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/women-in-open-source)

## Python is for the birds

[![Bird Syth]({{ "/assets/21219bird.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipObpWkIewLxXxJZ4Wn9RDsoZj7yA0uH5z3s3-FcviHkWsllVWnpSei6IbpJMs3d2g?key=NENRX00xS0I4aFF0cXM3bDZlOG1rNDIwdjFSaG13)

Laen (owner of [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/)) made a prototype of an electronic bird toy.  To play music, load it up with .WAV files, and when the bird touches a screw, it'll play them - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/laen/status/1093557638292369408) & [photos](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipObpWkIewLxXxJZ4Wn9RDsoZj7yA0uH5z3s3-FcviHkWsllVWnpSei6IbpJMs3d2g?key=NENRX00xS0I4aFF0cXM3bDZlOG1rNDIwdjFSaG13).

## EduBlocks, Python, and more...

[![edublocks]({{ "/assets/21219edublocks.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-edublocks-with-circuit-playground-express?view=all)

Are you familiar with block-based programming and trying to make the jump to Python?

You're in luck! EduBlocks is a web-based programming interface that is making the transition from block-based programming languages like Scratch to the syntax-based language Python easier.

In this guide we will go through the EduBlocks editor interface and different code blocks - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-edublocks-with-circuit-playground-express?view=all)

## BLE Light switch with Feather nRF52840 and Crickit using CircuitPython

[![BLE light]({{ "/assets/21219switch.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluetooth-light-switch-with-crickit-and-nrf52840/overview)

Build your own Bluetooth, remote-controlled robotic light switch to turn on and off the lights! Using CircuitPython running on the Feather nRF52840 Express and Crickit FeatherWing to flip the switch with a servo motor, you can avoid all of the complexities and dangers of high voltage mains wiring!

The 3D printed actuator, mount, and case makes it reliable and tidy. And the Adafruit Bluefruit app running on your iOS or Android device makes it fun and easy! - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluetooth-light-switch-with-crickit-and-nrf52840/overview)

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/21219libs_418.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **131**!

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/21219hello.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
