[Timothy Garcia](http://www.timothygarcia.ca) sent [this wonderful](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/12/timothy-garcias-circuitpython-magazine-spread-eighthree/) CircuitPython magazine spread in, he writes *"I just wanted to share a magazine spread design I did themed around CircuitPython for my final exam for InDesign CC at Uni. It was a four-hour exam but felt like fifteen minutes because I enjoyed working with the content. I took the photos from the Adafruit Flickr, It was a great resource ! Thank you and to the rest of the Adafruit team for serving as an inspiration to many of my design school projects."* - [PDF](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/01/timothygarcia-finalexam.pdf).

## CircuitPython in 2019

[![CircuitPython in 2019]({{ "/assets/11519cpc.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/17/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2019-circuitpython2019-circuitpython/)

As 2018 comes to a close we like to reflect on how the year went and set goals for 2019. In the last two years ([2017](https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/01/09/welcome-to-the-adafruit-circuitpython-beta/), [2018](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/01/29/circuitpython-in-2018/)) this has been a blog post by Scott (aka tannewt). For 2019, we’d like to do it a bit differently. This time we’d like everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the Internet.

We’ll read these over the holidays and into the first half of January. After the January 14th CircuitPython weekly we’ll draft an overarching vision post for CircuitPython in 2019 and discuss it in the following meeting.

See [the blog post for more details](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/17/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2019-circuitpython2019-circuitpython/).

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **127**!

**New Libraries!**

Here's this week's new CircuitPython libraries:

* [Adafruit CircuitPython ADT7410](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_ADT7410)

* [Adafruit CircuitPython BoardTest](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BoardTest)

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

**PyPI Download Stats!**

[![PyPI Download Stats]({{ "/assets/11519tuxtux.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="480px"}](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/)

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

## Adafruit library usage on Raspberry Pi

[![Blinka Pi]({{ "/assets/blinkapi.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/tree/master/libraries/drivers)

Thanks to some database query'in by Raspberry Pi Community Manager [Ben Nuttall](https://bennuttall.com/), we've got some nifty stats to share about Adafruit library usage on Raspberry Pi! [Piwheels](https://www.piwheels.org/) is the Raspberry Pi 'PyPi Mirror' and is the site most Pi users grab files from when they run 'pip'.

[![Adafruit library usage on Raspberry Pi]({{ "/assets/115downloads.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/tree/master/libraries/drivers)

This graph shows month-over-month (not cumulative) growth of some of the core Adafruit python support libraries. Not too surprising, lots of people are using them now that we've got 125+ CircuitPython drivers and libraries that can now be used on [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/tree/master/libraries/drivers).

Starting in May 2018, the big increase is from when we went thru all our guides to test and add Pi wiring/usage info, while deprecating our old "pure python" drivers. You can also see a dip in Adafruit-GPIO downloads in December, which is when we moved Blinka to using Adafruit-PlatformDetect for determining which Raspi we're running on and removed the dependancy.

We expect to see more and more Raspberry Pi / Linux users taking advantage of our huge collection of CircuitPython library in 2019! Stay tuned for more stats throughout the year.

And a note from the community... via [Twitter RPJ's bots @rpjios](https://twitter.com/rpjios/status/1084554192256040960) writes - "I’m already relying heavily on your libraries for my RPi sensor data platform... Thank you *so much* for being such an awesome and prolific community contributor. You’re single-handily enabling so many amazing things!"

**piwheels stats for 2018**

piwheels was launched in mid-2017, and started counting downloads in November of that year, so now there is over a year’s worth of data on which packages have been downloaded, and how much time has been saved.

If you’re not familiar, piwheels.org is a Python package repository providing natively compiled wheels for the Raspberry Pi’s Arm architecture, making pip installations fast for Raspberry Pi users.

In 2018, a total of 5,154,233 packages were downloaded, saving users 39 years, 10 months and 29 days. Some more stats for the year:

*   Average daily downloads: 14,519
*   Average monthly downloads: 429,519
*   Most downloads in one day: 25,389 on 30 November
*   Most downloads in one month: 662,621 in December (21,445 daily average)

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/11519translate.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
