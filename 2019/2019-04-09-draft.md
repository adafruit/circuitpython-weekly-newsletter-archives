## The joys of using Python on embedded devices - Keynote at PyCon!

[![PyCon keynote](../assets/04092019/4919nina.jpg)](https://us.pycon.org/2019/keynote-speakers/#nina)

[PyCon announced](https://twitter.com/pycon/status/1113456834143240194) that Nina Zakharenko will be a keynote speaker this year at PyCon! Nina will share the joys of using Python on embedded devices and how it impacts and grows our community!

Nina is a software engineer with over a decade of experience. She currently focuses on Python at Microsoft on the Cloud Developer Advocacy team. In the past, she’s written software for satellite control computers at HBO, code that's helped people connect over their passions at Meetup, and implemented time-wasting features on Reddit.

Nina loves teaching developers and has spoken at conferences like PyCon Russia, EuroPython, and DjangoCon in the US and internationally. This year, she's looking forward to attending her seventh PyCon, where you'll find her co-organizing Mentored Sprints for Diverse Beginners.

## Python snakes its way to USB Hubs!

[![Capable Robot Programmable USB hub](../assets/04092019/4919usb01.jpg)](https://www.crowdsupply.com/capable-robot-components/programmable-usb-hub)

The Capable Robot Programmable USB hub is a USB hub that's also a dev board and an I2C, GPIO, and SPI bridge. In addition to being a 4-port USB 2 High-Speed hub, this Programmable USB hub it is also a CircuitPython based development board!

[![Capable Robot Programmable USB hub](../assets/04092019/4919usb02.jpg)](https://www.crowdsupply.com/capable-robot-components/programmable-usb-hub)

An ATSAMD51 microcontroller configures the USB hub IC and is available for you to reprogram to change the behavior of your hub. The microcontroller ships with open source CircuitPython firmware which is updatable over the MCU USB connector. No drivers or reflashing hardware is needed – Python firmware shows up as files on a small flash hard drive when connected to your computer and can be immediately edited.

[![Capable Robot Programmable USB hub](../assets/04092019/4919usb03.jpg)](https://www.crowdsupply.com/capable-robot-components/programmable-usb-hub)

We've signed up for updates on the [Crowd Supply Page](https://www.crowdsupply.com/capable-robot-components/programmable-usb-hub)! We'll see if we can get one to review as well.

This effort is to get Python on hardware to the most folks out there, at the events that bring people together.

This is just one of many efforts we’re teaming up with Digi-Key to continue to fuel all the developers from beginners to pro, using Python on microcontrollers.

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!

The PyCon 2019 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.

We will have a lot more updates, stay tuned to the [Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit), [Discord](http://adafru.it/discord), and more!

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hellow World](../assets/04092019/4919hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
