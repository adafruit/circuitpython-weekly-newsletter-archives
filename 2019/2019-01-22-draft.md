## CircuitPython support for the Makerdiary nRF52840 MDK added

[![Makerdiary nRF52840 MDK]({{ "/assets/12219makerdiary.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/1470)

Support for CircuitPython has been added to the [Makerdiary nRF52840 MDK USB dongle](https://wiki.makerdiary.com/nrf52840-mdk-usb-dongle/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/1470). 

The nRF52840 Micro Dev Kit USB Dongle is a small and low-cost development platform enabled by the nRF52840 multiprotocol SoC in a convenient USB dongle form factor.

The nRF52840 Micro Dev Kit USB Dongle features a programmable user button, RGB LED, up to 12 GPIOs and 2.4G Chip antenna on board.

The USB Dongle can be used as a low-cost Bluetooth5/Tread/802.15.4/ANT/2.4GHz multiprotocol node or development board. Alternatively the USB Dongle can be used as a Network Co-Processor(NCP) with a simple connection to a PC or other USB enabled device.

## CircuitPython snakes its way to the SparkFun LumiDrive LED Driver

[![LumiDrive]({{ "/assets/12219lumi.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lumidrive-hookup-guide)

More boards are supporting CircuitPython! Check out the SparkFun LumiDrive LED Driver. Here's how and why SparkFun chose CircuitPython for their latest board, the LumiDrive LED Driver.

*"Circuit Python is Adafruit’s version of MicroPython. What pray tell, is MicroPython? MicroPython is Python 3 for microcontrollers. MicroPython takes the power of the wildly popular Python interpreted language that is easy to use, easy to read, and powerful and makes it usable for microcontrollers. It feels familiar in the way you declare and use pins but unlike Arduino, you don’t have to compile or upload your code. This is because your microcontroller acts like a USB drive when you plug it into your computer. The code simply lives as a file that you modify directly and when it’s saved, it is automatically loaded. Algebraic! It’s also compatible with the Python 3 you have on your computer so that you can develop seamlessly on your desktop! Why are we using Circuit Python? Circuit Python has the advantage of having many libraries built in by default that are catered toward entry-level hobbyists. In the case of the LumiDrive, we’ll be utilizing the DotStar library, Adafruit’s library for APA102 LEDs."*

For 2019, we asked what everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the Internet, and you did! Thank you! We've collected them on the blog tagged, #CircuitPython2019 - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%23circuitpython2019).

Soon we’ll draft an overarching vision post for CircuitPython in 2019 and discuss it in the weekly CircuitPython meetings on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord), 2pm ET, every Monday.

How to control motors from Raspberry Pi with Adafruit DC Motor Controller and CircuitPython - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/scijoy/raspberry-pi-robot-controlled-by-twitter-2169f6). SciJoy learned how to control DC motors with a Raspberry Pi Zero W and an Adafruit Feather Motor Controller board using CircuitPython. They learned how to use the TB6612FNG chip to drive the motors. That chip has two full h-bridge circuits to control the direction of the motors. The Feather also has a PCA9685 chip, which is a PWM driver. It communicates with the Raspberry Pi over I2C. The robot uses the Blinka library to translate between Python 3 and the CircuitPython libraries - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/r9AXgc59if4).

We're previewing a fun CircuitPython powered IoT device, in testing we're using some APIs to get live data, including sites like hackaday. The in-progress project is posted on hackaday.io and there's a post about it! [HACKING HACKADAY.IO FROM CIRCUITPYTHON](https://hackaday.com/2019/01/18/hacking-hackaday-io-from-circuitpython/) -

[![hackaday]({{ "/assets/12219hadioskulls.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://hackaday.com/2019/01/18/hacking-hackaday-io-from-circuitpython/)

Here's what Hackaday had to say about the project, and specifically CircuitPython - *"We’ve been seeing a lot of CircuitPython code lately. Just in case you’re not familiar with it, CircuitPython is Adafruit’s version of Micropython, a python language targeted at embedded processors. While it sounds like something concocted purely to make old-school embedded-C programmers grumble, it’s actually powerful and convenient for embedded prototyping and development. Fueled by the speed of the latest inexpensive microcontrollers and a rapidly growing set of libraries that take the sting out of using integrated peripherals and common hacker-friendly parts, it offers a solid alternative to older embedded frameworks. There are lots of examples around if you want to get started.'*

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/12219hello.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
