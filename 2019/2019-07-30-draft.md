[![PyOhio](../assets/07302019/73019kattnir.jpg)](https://www.pyohio.org/2019/presentations/126)

PyOhio was July 27-28, 2019 in Columbus, Ohio, USA! Kattni Rembor was the [opening keynote speaker](https://www.pyohio.org/2019/presentations/126)!

>_"In trying to learn Python, I stumbled into a passion I had never considered. My path began with learning Python on hardware. Through mentorship and the help of friends, I began to flourish. Since then I have continued to contribute in ways I never thought possible, between code, community, and becoming a mentor myself. This is the story of my journey and how mentorship can change lives._"

PyOhio is a non-profit annual Python community conference held in Columbus, OH. It was free to attend and welcomes anyone with an interest in Python. Content ranged from beginner to advanced and was intended to be relevant to all types of Python users: students, software professionals, scientists, hobbyists, and anyone looking to learn more. There were keynotes, tutorials, talks, sprints, open spaces, lightning talks and more - [PyOhio](https://www.pyohio.org/2019/).

## STM32 support snakes its way to CircuitPython!

[![STM32](../assets/07302019/73019stm3201.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/2007)

[![STM32](../assets/07302019/73019stm3202.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/2007)

This is a bit of a coming soon but deserves its own news item! Add STM32 Discovery [F412ZG](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f412zg.html) and [F411RE](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f411re.html) support by [@hierophect](https://github.com/hierophect) - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/2007):

>_"This PR adds rudimentary support for the STM32F4 series. Supported features are REPL access over UART, and Microcontroller, Board and DigitalIO object support. Specify USB=FALSE when building. Also includes minor additions to Main.c and supervisor files to add preprocessor exclusion of optional modules for early stage ports, and fixes a potential bug in the nrf port."_

## stemma and stemma QT - easy connections!

[![stemma](../assets/07302019/73019stemma_stemmaQTb.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt?view=all)

Here is our latest STEMMA Sunday video! - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/_Cu7UOcGL14). STEMMA is not an original idea, we're working within an ecosystem of many other plug and play systems. We started STEMMA in 2014, and intended to be compatible with Grove only (cause that's all that existed at the time) but then when Qwiic came around in 2017, added a smaller connector so we could work with those parts too! STEMMA attempts to be as cross-compatible as possible with both Grove and Gravity (compatible connectors & 3-5V power/logic). STEMMA QT is cross-compatible with Qwiic - STEMMA QT connector/cable is same as Qwiic. You can use STEMMA QT devices with Qwiic devices/controllers - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt?view=all)

## Snekboard v0.2 Update: Snek sneks its way to CircuitPython

[![snek](../assets/07302019/73019snek.jpg)](https://keithp.com/blogs/snekboard-0.2/)

Snek sneks its way to CircuitPython, [Keith writes](https://keithp.com/blogs/snekboard-0.2/) - 

>_"I included a [W25Q16 2MB NOR flash chip](https://www.winbond.com/resource-files/w25q16jv%20spi%20revd%2008122016.pdf) on the board so that it could also run CircuitPython. Before finalizing the design, I thought it might be a good idea to actually get that running. I've submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/2018) with the necessary changes. I hope to see that merged at some point, which will allow users to select between CircuitPython and snek."_

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy.

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/07302019/73019blinka.png)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week.

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/07302019/73019hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
