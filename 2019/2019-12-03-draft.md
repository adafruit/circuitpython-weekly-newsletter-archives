## Native MP3 decoding/playback in CircuitPython

[![Mp3yon](../assets/12032019/12319mp3blinka.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4xh_mPaYG3s)

We’re testing out a new PR in CircuitPython by JEpler. This one adds native MP3 decoding – no playback chip required! Thanks to the patent expiration, we can now distribute MP3 decoding and its a great way to support compressed audio playback. We can even play 2 mp3’s at once. More than that isn’t possible yet due to RAM constraints. I’m testing an nRF52840 BLE feather with I2S. We’ll also try SAMD51 next. SAMD21 won’t be able to do it, due to the RAM requirements - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4xh_mPaYG3s).

## Circuitpython snakes its way to Fomu thanks to TinyUSB

My bench is currently occupied by prototypes of the ICM-20649, a fancy little 6-DoF IMU from ST. This one is special because it offers a much wider range of measurement than most other similar devices on the market. Capable of measuring +/- 30G of acceleration  and up to 4000 degrees per second of rotation, this is the sensor you want for capturing data on high impact and high performance applications.

Drivers are progressing and with a bit more time we'll dig into some of the other features lurking under the covers. I also recently made a large order of prototypes from the fab, so stay tuned for a big bunch of boards in the coming weeks.

**Dan**

I updated the Learn Guide code for all of our CircuitPython BLE projects, and the authors are now doing final testing. Some guides have already been updated. Next week Scott and I plan to get BLE bonding working so that we can conveniently support services like BLE HID. I've fixed a few bugs and reviewed lots of pull requests. We've had more  contributors to CircuitPython recently and we're getting many fixes and enhancements.

**JEpler**

I worked on making an existing MP3 decoder, Adafruit_MP3, usable from CircuitPython.  So far it's been lightly tested on both nRF and SAM D51 boards, and it's time to chase bugs and improve code quality so it can be included in official builds.  Limor recorded a short video showing it off - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xh_mPaYG3s).

**Kattni**

In the land of guides, I finished up two guides: Ultrasonic Distance Sensors and Eink Gizmo. Both of those are in the works and will be ready soon. I tested some BLE updates to a couple of previous guides to verify everything still works with the latest CircuitPython. In the land of code, I did a complete refactor on the [Circuit Playground library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CircuitPlayground) to now include the [Circuit Playground Bluefruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333). You can now use all the same features available for Circuit Playground Express on the Bluefruit, as well as [two new features available for Bluefruit only](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/circuitplayground/en/latest/api.html#adafruit-circuitplayground-bluefruit)! The plan is to eventually add some of the Bluetooth setup to the Bluefruit module to make it super simple to get going with all the hardware features on the Bluefruit. Check it out and keep an eye on it for new updates!

**Melissa**

This past week I finished up the Arduino pages for the eInk Gizmo guide. This included adding eInk support to the Arduino ImageReader library. Since it was a short week with the holidays, I took the opportunity to catch up on a lot of the small things that had been put on hold while I was updating guides. I went through and performed lots of CircuitPython code updates for outstanding issues, finished reviewing Pull Requests, and made small Guide updates. Next up, I will be adding some more examples to the IS31FL3731 CharliePlex library and updating any associated Learn Guides.

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/12032019/12319blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!
