## 6,000 Thanks! Python on Hardware is happening!

[![6000 Thanks](../assets/07022019/72196kthanks.jpg)](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/)

We started the Python on microcontrollers newsletter in November of 2016, since then we've published 129 newsletters (including this one!). We're so thankful for all the readers and contributors. We are celebrating over 6,000 subscribers as of last week, thank you! Check out all the archives here - [adafruitdaily.com](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## CircuitPython 4.1.0 Beta 1 Released!

[![CircuitPython 4.1.0 Beta 1 Released](../assets/07022019/72194beta.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/4.1.0-beta.1)

4.1.0's biggest feature is speed! General execution of Python should be 2-5x faster and display refreshing will be faster as well.

This is the second beta version for testing. It shouldn't break any code compatible with previous 4.x releases. Please use the latest 4.x stable release [(available from the new website!)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads) when first starting with CircuitPython. It is stable.

## CircuitPython Powered AT Hand-Raiser

[![CircuitPython Powered AT Hand-Raiser](../assets/07022019/7219trinket_Light3.gif)](https://learn.adafruit.com/AT-Hand-Raiser?view=all)

Bill has a great guide on [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/AT-Hand-Raiser?view=all) showing how to use CircuitPython to make an assistive hand-raiser - 

>_"Sometimes folks need help doing the simple things that most of us take for granted - that's where Assistive Technology comes into play.  For example, ATMakers recently had a college student reach out and ask for help getting her professor's attention in class. The problem was she has Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and couldn't raise her hand.  So, we created this small Trinket-powered device that attaches to her laptop or tablet and lights up when she wants to participate! Along the way, we found a fantastic way to control CircuitPython code using nothing more than the USB cord and Windows, Mac or Linux scripts loaded on the Trinket itself."_

## iOS 13 beta erases files off drive, resets iPad: FAT12 issue it seems…

[![iOS 13](../assets/07022019/7219ios13future.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/06/25/ios-13-beta-1-erases-files-off-drive-resets-ipad-fat12-issue-it-seems-apple/)

The upcoming iOS 13 allows iPads to be more like computers, which means being able to do computer-like things such as plugging in a USB drive, opening up the Files app in iOS 13 and browsing the files. This is going to be fantastic for folks who want to use an iPad as their full-time desktop replacement, and if you’re a coder it looks like you’ll be able to do things like opening up Python .py files, use IDEs for coding, etc.

However! iOS beta 1 deletes files off some devices that are USB-Drive-like, for example, all the CircuitPython boards. The iPad also resets itself, so that’s not super-great either.

We documented it [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ddhFHehK-4) the best we could to make sure it's fixed before the iOS 13 release - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/06/25/ios-13-beta-1-erases-files-off-drive-resets-ipad-fat12-issue-it-seems-apple/).

>_"We’ve been including the excellent Thonny Python development environment in Raspbian for some time now. In this release, it’s now our default Python editor, and to that end, we are no longer including IDLE by default. IDLE has always felt dated and not very pleasant to use, and Thonny is so much nicer that we’d strongly recommend moving to it, if you haven’t already! (If you’d like an alternative to Thonny, the Mu Python IDE is also still available in Recommended Software.)"_
