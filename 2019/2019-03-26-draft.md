In Make: **Tech Trend #1: The Push for Python**. Make’s overview of Python support for electronics, including Adafruit hardware and more, by Sam Brown.

>_“Were seeing a raft of Python-friendly boards in this year’s round-up of new microcontrollers. Leading the charge is Adafruit. In the last year they’ve launched Python-friendly “Express” versions of their top boards, from the tiny Trinket to the student-friendly Circuit Playground to the Arduino-like Metro and mega-sized Grand Central, and plenty more sizes in between. Whatever your project, Adafruit came out with a Python-capable board to match.”_

> _Embedded system or firmware programming can be very intimidating for beginners and often they tend to drop it very soon, thanks to connecting wires across a breadboard and writing bits and bytes to processor registers using bit shifting and logical operations.  Enter MicroPython and CircuitPython which let’s you program microcontrollers using everyone’s favourite Python programming language, no toolchain, cross compiler, assembler required. The code lives on your board itself and every lower level detail is abstracted. And if you think you can just blink LEDs with it, you just imagined tip of the iceberg. You can actually track the current location of International Space station and turn on an alarm when it is passing above you. Quite Interesting hah, There is so much we can do with it and it’s not scary.  Talk included Introduction and some example project showcase and can also include basic hands-on experience._

This effort is to get Python on hardware to the most folks out there, at the events that bring people together.

This is just one of many efforts we’re teaming up with Digi-Key to continue to fuel all the developers from beginners to pro, using Python on microcontrollers.

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/32619team.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!

The PyCon 2019 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.
