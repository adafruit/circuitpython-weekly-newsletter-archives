## Middle School students make teacher “escape rooms” with CircuitPython

[![CircuitEscape](../assets/05282019/52819students.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/05/22/via-discord-middle-school-students-make-teacher-escape-rooms-circuitplaygroundexpress-circuitpython-msmakecode-adafruit/)

Teacher Daniel, on the Adafruit Discord chat, [writes about his Middle School students’ projects](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/05/22/via-discord-middle-school-students-make-teacher-escape-rooms-circuitplaygroundexpress-circuitpython-msmakecode-adafruit/):

_"I wanted to show some pictures of my Middle School students who made an “escape room” (really a number of puzzles) based on the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express board. They did an awesome job of coming up with all sorts of fun puzzles, all of which used the Circuit Playground in some form or fashion. We created a number of puzzles that, when they are all solved, lead to the key to a treasure chest full of candy. We took the puzzles to 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade classrooms, where the teachers would try to solve the puzzles in 30 minutes, with all of their students cheering them on. If they could solve all the puzzles and unlock the treasure chest, their students would get candy! These are just a few of the students and their puzzles. I had 14 students, 10 puzzles/projects, and a ton of fun!"_

## CircuitPython: HOW-TO Creating Custom Boards!

[![Custom boards](../assets/05282019/52819customboards.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/wallarug/circuitpython-creating-custom-boards-8e979e)

Want to run Adafruit's cool new electronics Python distribution on your board? Now you can! - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/wallarug/circuitpython-creating-custom-boards-8e979e) by Cian B:

>_"Over the past six months I have spent a lot of time porting different libraries to the Robo HAT MM1 board developed by Robotics Masters. This has lead to discovering a lot about these libraries, how they work behind the scenes and most importantly - what to do to add new boards in the future. This is the second in a series of write-ups I will be doing to help others who wish to port libraries for their boards. Many of the sources of information can be vague or difficult for outsiders to understand. I hope to ‘demystify’ and explain how to achieve a successful port for everyone. Today, we will be looking at the CircuitPython (and MicroPython) platform. It is a growing community started by Adafruit and is very active. There are currently only a few different board variants - mostly produced by Adafruit - but has gotten a lot of traction lately thanks to new Crowd Supply projects (like the Robo HAT MM1)."_

## Issue 19 – HackSpace magazine Laser-cut jewelry with CircuitPython

[![Laser-cut jewelry](../assets/05282019/52819sophy.png)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/05/24/issue-19-hackspace-magazine-laser-cut-jewellery-by-sophywong-gemma-adafruit-neopixels-wearables-circuitpython-hackspacemag/)

The new [HackSpace Magazine Issue 19](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/19) highlights laser-cut NeoPixel necklaces by Sophy Wong -

_"Jewelry is meant to be shiny, so it’s the perfect place for multicolor NeoPixel LEDs! The trick is: how to get everything you need for a NeoPixel circuit to fit inside a small piece like a pendant. Enter the laser cutter! Laser cutters are great for precision cuts in materials like thin wood and acrylic. In this project, we’ll use a laser cutter to create a sleek necklace that shines bright with NeoPixels from Adafruit. We’ll build the necklace in layers with precise cut‑outs to house our electronic components. Our favorite wearable microcontroller, Adafruit’s Gemma M0, will control the NeoPixels, and we’ll write a program in CircuitPython that will make the most of a tiny battery."_

## Feather format takes flight with the SparkFun Thing Plus

[![FeatherThing](../assets/05282019/52819sfe.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14713)

Adafruit Feather format takes flight with the [SparkFun Thing Plus – SAMD51 – DEV-14713](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14713) -

"_Is it power you seek? With a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4F MCU, the SparkFun SAMD51 Thing Plus is one of our most powerful microcontroller boards yet! The SAMD51 Thing Plus provides you with an economical and easy to use development platform if you’re needing more power with minimal working space. This Thing even comes flashed with the same convenient UF2 bootloader as the RedBoard Turbo. To make the Thing Plus even easier to use, we’ve moved a few pins around to make the board Feather compatible…"_

UF2 bootloader, Feather pin layout, should also be easy to get CircuitPython runnin’ on it too. According to [one of the developers](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2930#comment-5ce8150487756d6dfa678ce3), expect it soon *"The CircuitPython firmware for the board should be built up next week."*

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/05282019/52819hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/05282019/52819codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
