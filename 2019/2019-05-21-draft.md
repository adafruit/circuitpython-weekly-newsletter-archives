## CircuitPython on Python Podcast!

[![init](../assets/05212019/52119init.jpg)](https://www.pythonpodcast.com/circuitpython-hardware-hacking-episode-212/)

Podcast.__init__ has stories of the people that make the Python community great, here's one with CircuitPython and Scott! [Hardware Hacking Made Easy With CircuitPython, Episode 212](https://www.pythonpodcast.com/circuitpython-hardware-hacking-episode-212/) -

>_"Learning to program can be a frustrating process, because even the simplest code relies on a complex stack of other moving pieces to function. When working with a microcontroller you are in full control of everything so there are fewer concepts that need to be understood in order to build a functioning project. CircuitPython is a platform for beginner developers that provides easy to use abstractions for working with hardware devices. In this episode Scott Shawcroft explains how the project got started, how it relates to MicroPython, some of the cool ways that it is being used, and how you can get started with it today. If you are interested in playing with low cost devices without having to learn and use C then give this a listen and start tinkering!"_

## Python snakes its way to MakeCode

[![MakeCode Python](../assets/05212019/52119makecode.jpg)](http://www.micropython.org.cn/bbs/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=2661)

Turns out there is a Python mode in Microsoft MakeCode via [MicroPython.org.cn](http://www.micropython.org.cn/bbs/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=2661). Here's how to find it, visit: https://arcade.makecode.com/beta and then click About, then Experiments and enabled "Static Python." That's it! Here' how to [convert a MicroPython module(s)](https://makecode.com/cli/pyconv) to PXT, [pyconv.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt/blob/master/cli/pyconv.ts), and [Static Python](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt/commit/7e4dd3ede29a96b6e1302095b3141d771926358f).

## The History of CircuitPython

[![History of CircuitPython](../assets/05212019/52119scott.jpg)](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/05/scott-shawcroft-history-of-circuitpython.html)

Great summary of Scott's talk, ["The History of CircuitPython"](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/05/scott-shawcroft-history-of-circuitpython.html) at the 2019 PyCon Python Language Summit by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis -

>_To build a Python for Adafruit’s needs, Shawcroft forked MicroPython and created a new project, CircuitPython. In his Language Summit talk, he emphasized it is a “friendly fork”: both projects are MIT-licensed and share improvements in both directions. In contrast to MicroPython’s hardware APIs that vary by chip, CircuitPython has one hardware API, allowing Adafruit to write one set of libraries for them all._

A couple Kickstarters are coming out, and a couple of them could run CircuitPython, so if ya back'em, post in the comments and request it - depending on the chip, it's pretty easy to add. For the [PocketScreen](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zepsch/pocketscreen-worlds-smallest-arduino-compatible-mu), we already support the ATSAMD21G18 so the creator would only need to make a new 'board definition' with the name, VID/PID and the pinouts available. This [recent pull request](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/1873) has the basics of what is required. Want to try it out? Build the [variant on your own here](https://learn.adafruit.com/building-circuitpython). You can test it on your board before submitting the PR.

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/05212019/52119hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
