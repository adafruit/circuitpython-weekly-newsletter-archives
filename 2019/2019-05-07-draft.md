PyCon2019 was a great success this weekend! Especially so for showcasing Python on hardware. All attendees received a Digi-Key sponsored Adafruit Circuit Playground Express. Some great fun was had. One highlight was a keynote talk by Nina Zakharenko.

Nina discusses making physical things, her background, and her melding of hardware with the growing use of Python in education and society. With a few lines of Python, you can make lights glow, react to buttons, make music, and much, much more. Edit code in any text editor, copy it ti the flash drive that shows up when a board is plugged in, the code runs! No software development environment required!

## Announcing the winners of the 2019 Women in Open Source Awards – Limor Fried

[![Red Hat Open Source Award](../assets/05072019/5719redhat_logo.jpg)](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/announcing-winners-2019-women-open-source-awards)

Some big news we're pleased to share!

>_Throughout the open source community, developers, programmers, engineers and enthusiasts are making an impact, sometimes one line of code at a time. In addition to their technical contributions, they’re making an impact by advocating for and mentoring others, ultimately bringing more people into the open source community. At Red Hat, we celebrate that impact and the hard work and dedication it requires. As we kick off Red Hat Summit 2019, we’re proud to announce this year’s winners of the Women In Open Source Awards: Limor Fried and Saloni Garg. Their contributions are innovative examples of how open source is being used to make a difference in people’s lives and is well positioned to inspire future generations. In its fifth year, the Women in Open Source Awards were created and sponsored by Red Hat to honor women who make important contributions to open source projects and communities, or those making innovative use of open source methodology. Nominations for this year’s awards were accepted for two categories: academic (those currently enrolled in a college or university) and community (those working on or volunteering with projects related to open source). A panel of judges determined finalists based on nomination criteria, and the public voted to determine the award winners._

>_Limor Fried, who was recognized in the community category, is the founder and lead engineer at Adafruit Industries, an open source hardware company designed to be a place for people to learn about and purchase open tools, equipment and electronics online. Adafruit has grown to more than 100 employees and is 100% woman-owned. Fried personally selects, tests and approves each product before it is added to the Adafruit store. With more than 13 years in the open source community, she is a strong advocate for open source hardware and software. She led the effort in writing open source tutorials at learn.adafruit.com, providing more than 1,700 designs for makers to build and learn from, and developed Circuit Playground Express—an all-in-one exploratory circuit board widely adopted in schools, colleges, and STEM organizations. Fried also hosts the YouTube show “Ask an Engineer,” one of the longest-running live weekly Internet shows on STEM, and “Show and Tell,” a show that allows makers to share their creations. She is on the advisory board of IEEE Spectrum magazine and spends time mentoring other women who own small businesses._

>_The CircuitPython development environment is brilliantly simple. You just copy the source files onto the 2 Megabyte USB drive, and CircuitPython detects that they have changed and auto-reloads them. This is so much easier than the Arduino, and it’s even easier than MicroPython itself, which (as far as I know) doesn’t support auto-reload._

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

## circuitpython.org updates!

Downloads are now available from [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org)! This site makes it much easier to select the correct file and language for your board. The downloads page is [here](https://circuitpython.org/downloads). Here are the latest boards added! **There are 53+ boards!**

**Libraries @CircuitPython ... Easiest way to get the latest library bundles!**

[![circuitpython.org](../assets/05072019/5719circuitpython-org.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

[circuitpython.org/libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) is the easiest way to get all the latest CircuitPython libraries. Sure, you can always use [GitHub and look at all 155+ of them](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md), but this is way easier... and in mpy for optimized experiences!

> The CircuitPython Library Bundle contains all current libraries available for CircuitPython. They are designed for use with CircuitPython and may or may not work with MicroPython. The bundle options are explained (on the page)... CircuitPython libraries are separate files designed to work with CircuitPython code. CircuitPython programs require a lot of information to run. CircuitPython is so simple to use because most of this information is processed in the background and stored in libraries. Some libraries are built into CircuitPython. Others are downloaded and stored on your CIRCUITPY drive in a folder called lib. The full list of all the CircuitPython libraries contained in the following bundles can be found on the [libraries page](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/bundle/en/latest/drivers.html).

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello World](../assets/05072019/5719hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
