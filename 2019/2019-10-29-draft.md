## CircuitPython snakes its way to the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

[![Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](../assets/10292019/102929arduinonano.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/board/arduino_nano_33_ble/)

The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense now runs [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/board/arduino_nano_33_ble/).

This compact and reliable [NANO board](https://circuitpython.org/board/arduino_nano_33_ble/) is built around the NINA B306 module, based on Nordic nRF 52840 and containing a powerful Cortex M4F. Its architecture, has a 9 axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a reduced power consumption compared to other same size boards. This allows the design of wearable devices and movement sensing projects that need to communicate to other devices at a close range. Arduino NANO 33 BLE is also ideal for automation projects thanks to the multiprotocol BT 5.0 radio - [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/board/arduino_nano_33_ble/).

## CircuitPython powered ElectronicCats

[![Electronic Cats](../assets/10292019/102919meowmeow.jpg)](https://electroniccats.com/producto/meowmeow/)

All month long we’ve looked at some of the history of open-source hardware and many of the companies/people that have helped get us all here. Today is about the future! One of the more recent companies in the open-source hardware world that I’ve been really delighted to see is [ElectronicCats](https://electroniccats.com/). [ElectronicCats](https://electroniccats.com/) designs, creates, and shares open hardware, made in México.

Check out their product line up and their events/social/blog. They get it, they’re building and sharing some of the best open-source hardware, these folks are the future. And by that I mean we’ll see more international efforts, and more creativity infused in to the community specifically because of their efforts - [Read more](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/10/25/electronic-cats-open-hardware-made-in-mxico-ohm2019-oshwa-ohsummit-opensource-opensourcehardware-opensourceorg-adafruit-electronicats/).

They’ve also been [quick to adopt](https://circuitpython.org/downloads?manufacturers=Electronic+Cats) where the community is going with python on hardware. [Meow Meow is a fantastic and fun board](https://electroniccats.com/producto/meowmeow/) and runs CircuitPython.

## Circuit Playground Bluefruit low power tests

[![Circuit Playground Bluefruit low power tests](../assets/10292019/1029194333-11.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/10/25/circuitplayground-bluefruit-low-power-tests-adafruit-bluefruit-arduino-circuitpython/)

Doing some low power testing for a revision of the CircuitPlayground Bluefruit, our prototype has the ability to turn off the neopixels/light/temp/mic sensor in addition to the speaker amp. When we do that, we drop down to 280uA quiescent when we go to sleep, code is about 6mA.

Here’s what it looks like when we wake from sleep and enable the neopixels and sensors, hang out for a bit, then go back to sleep. there’s a skinny spike of 50mA, maybe the neopixel PWM circuitry turning on at once?

## CircuitPython snakes its way to the SparkFun Qwiic Micro – SAMD21 Development Board

## MicroPython, bringing Python to hardware for everyone

[![MicroPython](../assets/10292019/102919mpheader.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/10/22/micropython-bringing-python-to-hardware-for-everyone-ohm2019-oshwa-ohsummit-opensource-opensourcehardware-opensourceorg-micropython-micropython/)

It's open-source hardware month, we've been doing a post every day, all month. One of the posts is all about MicroPyton. We think the next chapter for electronics is Python, from powerful Raspberry Pi computers to low-cost microcontrollers which are able to drive robotics, to running Machine Learning, [the most popular programming language in the world (Python)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/09/08/the-top-programming-languages-2019-python-tops-the-charts-with-a-circuitpython-nod-circuitpython-micropython-ieeespectrum-python/) has arrived on hardware, and we have MicroPython and its creator, Damien George, to thank. From the [micropython.org](http://micropython.org/) about page -

> MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments. The MicroPython pyboard is a compact electronic circuit board that runs MicroPython on the bare metal, giving you a low-level Python operating system that can be used to control all kinds of electronic projects. MicroPython is packed full of advanced features such as an interactive prompt, arbitrary precision integers, closures, list comprehension, generators, exception handling and more. Yet it is compact enough to fit and run within just 256k of code space and 16k of RAM. MicroPython aims to be as compatible with normal Python as possible to allow you to transfer code with ease from the desktop to a microcontroller or embedded system.

There's also a good history of [MicroPython over on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroPython), and [we've posted about some of the early days, history, and its recent 6th birthday...](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/04/29/happy-6th-birthday-micropython-micropython-micropython/)

> *   29th April 2013: first line of code written (in private, before anyone knew about it, before it was even called Micro-Python)
> *   17th Sept 2013: first code running on a microcontroller, on the very first prototype of the pyboard
> *   2nd Oct 2013: register micropython.org
> *   4th Oct 2013: first commit in what is now the main repository
> *   late Dec 2013: source code up on GitHub
> *   21st June 2014: last of the Kickstarter rewards sent out (for the first Kickstarter)

[![Early Days of MicroPython](../assets/10292019/102919mped.jpg)](https://youtu.be/NBAqOYYW6vM)

The Early Days of MicroPython - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/NBAqOYYW6vM).

> _"April 29, 2019 is the sixth 'birthday' of MicroPython. At the April Melbourne Meetup, Damien George, creator of MicroPython, delves into his archives and shows the earliest code and notes about the goals of the language. The material pre-dates the first git commit! Listen in as Damien reveals how and why the language began and evolved. It's a nice way to celebrate MicroPython's sixth birthday!"_

[In newsletter #8 from MicroPython, Damien published](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=6356) some never-before-seen details about the start of MicroPython.

> Here is an excerpt from the initial notes. The title is "Python board" and the date is 29 April 2013: Python board 29/4/2013 The smallest, cheapest python. A piece of hardware that is small and cheap, runs python scripts, and has good low-level access to hardware. If we can do it with a single chip, that would keep it small and cheap. Need then something with a large amount of flash and a decent amount of RAM, that also is cheap enough. Atmel SAM's have order 1MiB flash and 128KiB SRAM, for around $10 one-off. Main features:
> 
> *   Implements Python 3 core language.
> *   Flash presents as a flash drive with vfat filesystem.
> *   Put python scripts on flash and it runs them (maybe have a (multicolour?) led that flashes on error and writes a "core" dump to the flash). This led can also double as a user output led.
> *   Can run multiple scripts on once.
> 
> Our strength would be small, cheap, simple, easy to replicate. Can have a range of boards with different features. But all must be basically compatible and capable of running the same scripts.

## A Belated Happy Birthday to MQTT

[![MQTT](../assets/10292019/102919mqtt.png)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/10/22/a-belated-happy-birthday-to-mqtt-iotuesday-mqtt-andysc-ibm-arlennipper/)

MQTT, or message queue telemetry transport, is a protocol for device communication. Using a MQTT library or client you can publish and subscribe to a feed to send and receive feed data.

About 20 years ago, the first version of the MQTT was published. We’re big fans of this stateful, low-bandwidth, pubsub protocol.

CircuitPython has its own MQTT library called MiniMQTT! [We have a guide about it here](https://learn.adafruit.com/mqtt-in-circuitpython). CircuitPython cloud-service provider libraries such as Adafruit IO, Google Cloud IoT Core, and Amazon AWS IoT utilize this library “under-the-hood” - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/10/22/a-belated-happy-birthday-to-mqtt-iotuesday-mqtt-andysc-ibm-arlennipper/).

[![Bryan](../assets/10292019/102919lps33w_headshot.png)](https://circuitpython.org/)

_"This week on my bench are a few new sensors: The LSM6DSOX IMU, LPS33W absolute pressure sensor and its sister from another mister, the LPS35HW. Keen eyed readers will notice that we already have an LPS35HW breakout. Indeed we do but along with the LPS33 it's getting a STEMMA QT upgrade, making it even easier to use. The main difference between the two is that the LPS33W is fitted with "nozzle" of sorts that can be fit with an o-ring and fit directly into a larger assembly."_

**Dan**

_"I need to add a new flash region to the nRF52840 build to store bonding information. To make that easier, I am parameterizing the linker scripts used to build CircuitPython so that build-specific constants like the sizes of the different internal flash memory regions and size of RAM can be defined in one place and passed into the linker scripts. Right now there are several places that must be edited manually if one of these values changes. Scott finished his rework of the native `_bleio` API and the `adafruit_ble` CircuitPython library. I've reviewed `_bleio` and am testing and creating examples in the new `adafruit_ble` API style. When these are both ready for alpha testing, we'll release them together as a new 5.0.0 alpha release."_

**Kattni**

_"This week I finished up [implementing the advanced features](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP9600/pull/3) of the MCP9600 thermocouple amplifier. You can now configure all the available options on each of the alert pins on the board using CircuitPython! There is an example available in [the documentation](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/mcp9600/en/latest/api.html). The MCP9600 guide is in the process of being updated with CircuitPython and Python usage. If you're looking for an I2C thermocouple amplifier you can use with CircuitPython, keep an eye out for that update! Next up, I'll be continuing to add CircuitPython and Python usage to more guides. All updated guides are blogged and linked in the newsletter to ensure you're on top of where we're at."_

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/10292019/102919jepler.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

_"I am learning the basics of Bluetooth and the Bluefruit app so I can help review PRs that touch on this area of CircuitPython. Here's the Bluefruit app running the color picker demo on a Circuit Playground Bluefruit."_

**Lucian**

_"This week I've been taking a break from UART to implement PWM, which has come along smoothly. I'll also be testing out DisplayIO, which makes use of many of the most recently added modules. I've also done some research and found some of the HAL peculiarities and error management specifics that might have been holding up the UART interrupt implementation. Hopefully I'll be able to quickly wrap up both modules this coming week, and begin expanding support for new STM32 boards."_

**Melissa**

_"This week I finished updating the eInk Display Breakouts guide updated the CircuitPython page with instructions for using displayio. I also added a Python section for using eInk displays on the Raspberry Pi and added a couple additional examples for using Pillow. You can checkout that guide [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-eink-display-breakouts). After that, I completed another guide for the 1.14" 240x135 TFT Display Breakout  which includes Arduino, CircuitPython and Python pages. You can check out that guide [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-14-240x135-color-tft-breakout.). I also added a couple more boards to the downloads page at https://circuitpython.org/downloads as well as wrote up a few Adafruit blog entries."_

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/10292019/102919helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
