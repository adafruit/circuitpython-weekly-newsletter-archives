## Consumers Should Immediately... Python the Circuit

[![Consumers Should Immediately](../assets/08202019/82019recalled5.jpg)](http://www.extrasleepy.com/#/recalled/)

This uses a live data feed from The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (USCPSC) to randomly display thousands of products recalled for reasons such as fire, electrocution, entrapment, choking and a variety of other unintended dangers. Every two minutes the embedded screen lists the name of the product, the identified danger, the product manufacturer, and the original recall date. The electronics are enclosed in an actual recalled children’s unicorn boot, along with an embedded rechargeable battery, allowing for an uninterrupted stream of recalled products in any location.

## What we're working on ...

[![Go team](../assets/08202019/82019teamz.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

There are lots of folks who work on CircuitPython or some of the many open-source boards, and open-source code for the community. Here's what Bryan, Dan, and Melissa are up this week!

**All a board' with Bryan**

Bryan is working on the CircuitPython driver for the super-cheap yet capable MS301 accelerometer - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MSA301/blob/master/MSA301-V1.0-ENG.PDF).

Bryan is also starting on the drivers for the APDS-9500 gesture sensor. This one will be a bit of a doozy, but has a lot of potential in its ability to detect directional gestures on the device itself, once we get them working - [PDF](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/678/V02-4584EN_DS_APDS-9500_2016-10-05-1076498.pdf).

[![BSBOARD](../assets/08202019/82019bsoled01.png)](https://www.adafruit.com/new)

[![BSBOARD](../assets/08202019/82019bsoled02.png)](https://www.adafruit.com/new)

The Large OLED Bonnet is coming along as well. This will be a great display with excellent readability due to the high contrast from being an OLED, combined with the larger pixels making for bigger text or images.

[![BSBOARD](../assets/08202019/82019bsbitsywing.png)](https://www.adafruit.com/new)

Lastly the super cool Airlift "BitsyWing" as we've been calling it should be headed to production soon.

This little helper will help squeeze WiFi and IOT goodness into even smaller places! I'm personally excited to put a bunch of these to use for some home automation tasks.

**CircuitPython Bluetooth Low energy from Dan**

[![CircuitPython Bluetooth Low energy from Dan](../assets/08202019/82019btblinka.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333)

CircuitPython Bluetooth Low energy can:

- be a BLE beacon, including as an iBeacon and an Eddystone beacon.
- be a BLE peripheral, acting both as a server providing services and as a client talking to a server.
- be a BLE central (can scan for peripherals that are advertising and connect to them).
  Currently the Nordic UART Service (NUS) is implemented both for clients and servers.
- pair with a peer device (but not bond, which is remembering pairing).
- connect to a device providing Current Time Service, such as an iPhone, and find out the current date and time.

Support has recently been added for fine-grained control of permissions of Charcteristics and Descriptors.
BLE HID support is current being implemented.

**Maker Melissa makes**

Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for new packages, active packages, new releases, and new authors are all in the double-digits:

* New packages: 43.28%
* Active packages: 47.31%
* New releases: 51.21%
* New authors: 39.30%

>_"...the number of connections or imports per package is increasing", and "annual growth rate in the number of imports [exceeds] the growth rates of the number of packages or releases alone by 10%."_

Top 10 most imported modules, in-order, are:

* __future__
* os
* sys
* logging
* re
* datetime
* json
* numpy
* unittest
* time

## PyCon AU - MicroPython recap from Matt

[![PyCon AU - MicroPython recap from Matt](../assets/08202019/82019pyconau_green.png)](https://twitter.com/matt_trentini/status/1161268811690938369)

[Matt sent these in](https://twitter.com/matt_trentini/status/1161268811690938369) last week after the newsletter went out, so here they are in this week's newsletter. Thank you Matt!

_THE_ Australian event for all things Python, PyCon AU 2019 was a huge success with many diverse and high-quality talks that covered the gamut of Python topics. MicroPython and CircuitPython were _very_ well represented with six talks covering Python on Hardware.

All of the 80+ talks were recorded and published on YouTube - take a look at the [PyCon AU 2019 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs4CJRBY5F1LKqauI3V4E_xflt6Gow611) or [browse the schedule](https://2019.pycon-au.org/schedule/friday/). 

MicroPython Sprints were organised for the Monday and Tuesday and these were well attended with some productive work achieved! Beginners to MicroPython (like [Leo](https://tumblelog.halloleo.net/post/186930271429/i-built-my-first-microcontroller-thing)) were warmly introduced, Damien guided folks to work on a spate of issues, two variants of a C stub generator ([uStubby](https://github.com/pazzarpj/micropython-ustubby) and [MicroPython C Stub Gen](https://gitlab.com/oliver.robson/mpy-c-stub-gen)) were worked on, the [QR Displayer](https://gitlab.com/oliver.robson/micropython-qr-displayer) project was released, a [CI server](https://gitlab.com/alelec/micropython_ci/) was configured to build _all_ (nearly 100!) the officially supported MicroPython variants and ♥️ was expressed with a [micro:bit](https://twitter.com/weatheredpup/status/1158705177613836288)! There was also collaboration with the [Fomu project](https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/fomu) and a port of MicroPython was built to run on the RISC-V softcore running on the Fomu FPGA - that lives _inside_ a USB port!

## Learning To Program In Python With CodeGrades

Learning To Program In Python With CodeGrades: Episode 224 - [Python Podcast](https://www.pythonpodcast.com/codegrades-learn-to-program-episode-224/).

>_"With the increasing role of software in our world there has been an accompanying focus on teaching people to program. There are numerous approaches that have been attempted to achieve this goal with varying levels of success. Nicholas Tollervey has begun a new effort that blends the approach adopted by musicians and martial artists that uses a series of grades to provide recognition for the achievements of students. In this episode he explains how he has structured the study groups, syllabus, and evaluations to help learners build projects based on their interests and guide their own education while incorporating useful skills that are necessary for a career in software. If you are interested in learning to program, teach others, or act as a mentor then give this a listen and then get in touch with Nicholas to help make this endeavor a success."_

**What is Mu?**

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy.
