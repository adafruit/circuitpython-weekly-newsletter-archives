## CircuitPython snakes its way to Gamebuino

[![Gamebuino](../assets/09032019/9319Gamebuino.jpg)](https://community.gamebuino.com/t/bringing-python-to-the-gamebuino-a-developers-blog/945)

[Soru's developer blog post](https://community.gamebuino.com/t/bringing-python-to-the-gamebuino-a-developers-blog/945) about porting CircuitPython to the Gamebuino, and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Rodot/Gamebuino-Circuitpython).

>_"Soru had already previously heard of MicroPython 1, a python port designed for embedded platform to “fit and run within just 256k of code space and 16k or RAM”. Sounds perfect for the gamebuino, right? So, let’s see if someone already made a port for the Arduino Zero. Why that arduino? Its hardware from a chipset perspective is the same as the gamebuino meta, and it is pretty popular, so there bound to be someone who ported it! And yes, as it turns out adafruit forked MicroPython, creating CircuitPython, and, look and behold, it already has official ports to atmel-samd based bored - including the Arduino Zero!"_

We are hoping the team at Gamebuino merges the changes into mainline and/or pull requests, will make things easier and better for them and the community together!

[![eink CircuitPython](../assets/09032019/9319eink02.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/preparing-graphics-for-e-ink-displays?view=all)

Back in the early Macintosh computer days, when the Earth’s crust was still cooling, getting photos and artwork to look presentable on these computers’ 1-bit monochrome displays was something of an art form.

Much of that know-how has fallen by the wayside as screens improved…but with wafer-thin, ultra-low-power 2- and 3-color E-Ink displays appearing everywhere now, a refresher in those techniques is suddenly relevant again, more so with CircuitPython and all the supported displays - [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/preparing-graphics-for-e-ink-displays?view=all) & [check out all the latest photos on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/search/?sort=date-taken-desc&safe_search=1&tags=einkepaper&user_id=35434449%40N08&view_all=1).

## CircuitPython powered 3D printed LoRa remote control

[![3D printed LoRa Remote Control](../assets/09032019/9319lora.jpg)](https://www.reddit.com/r/circuitpython/comments/cy3d5m/i_made_a_3d_printed_lora_remote_control_details/eypexi2/)

[back7.co writes](https://www.reddit.com/r/circuitpython/comments/cy3d5m/i_made_a_3d_printed_lora_remote_control_details/eypexi2/) -

>_"I just wrapped up another monthly project and I thought you all would like it. It's a simple LoRa (long range wireless) remote control, intended as a tool to help me do some LoRa-based robots. More on LoRa <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/lora-and-lorawan-radio-for-raspberry-pi/sending-data-using-a-lora-radio">here</a>. Inside is a simple 2-axis analog joystick and a trigger I found in my parts bin. I think it's from McMaster Carr but I couldn't find it. The board inside is the 900Mhz LoRa M0 Feather from Adafruit running CircuitPython, and there's a micro-usb connector on the end. The Feather shows up as a USB drive and the code runs live & reloads whenever I save the file, so it's a pretty easy way to troubleshoot as I go. More on CircuitPython <a href="https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/4.x/">here</a>. The code is simple and in early form, but is on Github here ( https://github.com/jdoscher/simple_lora_remote ) I designed all the parts in Tinkercad, as I am still far more comfortable there than in Fusion 360. The files on Tinkercad are <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/dGFL00i3tJf-lora-remote-control/edit">here</a> but the build list and parts are also listed on my Thingiverse entry <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3839282">here</a>. I'm doing about one project a month or so, and I'm documenting the progress on Instagram through neat photos. I hope you like it!

## What are Bryan, Dan, and Melissa up to?

[![Bryan](../assets/09032019/9319tlv_testing.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

[![Bryan](../assets/09032019/9319bryanimage.png)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

Byan finished up testing Kattni's TLV493D breakout and wrote the CircuitPython driver. This was an interesting one as there are no individually addressable registers like most I2C sensors. Instead you have to read bytes from the sensor until you get the information you need, and the same on writes. Next up, Bryan is working on the guide for the upcoming Airlift BitsyWing.

[![Dan](../assets/09032019/9319dan.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

Dan has CircuitPython BLE HID working on MacOS, Windows, Linux, and Chromebooks. It does not yet work on iOS, for unknown reasons, so Dan is debugging that with help from Thach, our resident BLE expert. Dan is also revising the bleio API so that Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors are added to their parent objects when they are created. And last up, Dan is adding compilation options to CircuitPython so that a custom build can enable and disable individual USB and USB HID devices. This takes a step toward user-defined HID devices.

[![Melissa](../assets/09032019/9319mel.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

Melissa has been working on writing up a guide on installing TensorFlow Lite on the Raspberry Pi 4. I have it working with Object Detection using the Raspberry Pi Camera and a PiTFT.

## Feather takes flight on the Kea Feather

[![Kea Feather](../assets/09032019/9319kea.png)](https://store.ingenuitymicro.com/kea)

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/09032019/9319helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
