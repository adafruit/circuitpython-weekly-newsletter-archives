## 200 CircuitPython Libraries!

[![200 CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/12102019/121019adafruit_200_libraries.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md)

The CircuitPython Library Bundle contains all current libraries available for CircuitPython.  CircuitPython libraries are separate files designed to work with CircuitPython code. CircuitPython programs require a lot of information to run. CircuitPython is so simple to use because most of this information is processed in the background and stored in libraries. Some libraries are built into CircuitPython. Others are downloaded and stored on your CIRCUITPY drive in a folder called lib.

The full list of all the CircuitPython libraries contained in the following bundles can be found on the libraries page.

And now there are 200! - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md) and [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

## CircuitPython snakes its way to Binho!

## Using Mu to plot sensor data with MCP2221 USB to I2C converter

[![MCP2221](../assets/12102019/121019MCP2221.jpg)](https://youtu.be/afOqJdf2MlU)

Here we are using Mu to plot sensor data with MCP2221 USB to I2C converter. We finished adding Blinka support for the low-cost MCP2221 USB to I2C/ADC/GPIO converter. This demo shows using Mu to plot sensor data with no microcontroller programming - we run Python natively on the PC, reading the sensor data through the USB/I2C converter. We think this could be really powerful when you want to do datalogging or analysis on a powerful computer, as there's no intermediary. We have 200+ CircuitPython libraries, and many are I2C-compatible sensors - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/afOqJdf2MlU).

[![ANCS](../assets/12102019/121019waitingCPB.jpg)](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/AppleNotificationCenterServiceSpecification/Introduction/Introduction.html)

[![ANCS](../assets/12102019/121019waitingmu.jpg)](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/AppleNotificationCenterServiceSpecification/Introduction/Introduction.html)

Working on some ideas for the [Apple Notification Center Service](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/AppleNotificationCenterServiceSpecification/Introduction/Introduction.html) (ANCS) that works with CircuitPython. What is ANCS?

The purpose of the Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS) is to give Bluetooth accessories (that connect to iOS devices through a Bluetooth low-energy link) a simple and convenient way to access many kinds of notifications that are generated on iOS devices.

The ANCS is designed around three principles: simplicity, efficiency and scalability. As a result, accessories ranging from simple LEDs to powerful “companion” devices with large displays can find the service useful.

**Dependencies**

The ANCS has no dependencies, apart from the standard set of Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) sub-procedures. An accessory acting as a GATT client is free to access and use other services provided by the iOS device while using the ANCS.

**Endianness and String Encoding**

Unless specified otherwise, all numerical values transmitted through the ANCS shall be little endian.

Unless specified otherwise, all string values transmitted through the ANCS shall be composed of unicode characters encoded with UTF-8.

**Terminology**

 * The Apple Notification Center Service shall be referred to as the ANCS.
 * The publisher of the ANCS service (the iOS device) shall be referred to as the Notification Provider (NP).
 * Any client of the ANCS service (an accessory) shall be referred to as a Notification Consumer (NC).
 * A notification displayed on an iOS device in the iOS Notification Center shall be referred to as an iOS notification.
 * A notification sent by a GATT characteristic as an asynchronous message shall be referred to as a GATT notification.

## What is the team up to this week?

What are we working on this week? Let's check!

**Bryan**  

[![Bryan](../assets/12102019/121019nunchuck.png)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Not much out of the ordinary to report this week: I've been working on the drivers for the ICM-20649 for CircuitPython and Arduino. After that I started working on the guide for the LSM6DSOX which should be out soon-ish!  

Next up I'll be bringing up some new boards and working on a rev for a simple project I've been wanting to do for a while. Get yer nunchucks ready!  

**Dan**  
I added some convenience features to the BLE library, so that you can set an advertising name other than the default one, and so it the name will show up before you connect the first time.  

I'm refactoring and parameterizing the linker scripts for CircuitPython, so that it's easy to specify different regions in the internal flash memory of the microcontroller. This is a precursor to creating a region in flash to store bonding information.  

I've been reviewing many pull requests for the BLE library and CircuitPython, and also helping out with Learn Guide code for BLE.  

**Jeff**  
While working on adding MP3 playback, I identified potential internal improvements for all the different kinds of audio sources in CircuitPython.  I'm working on making these improvements, as well as fixing problems identified during testing of the MP3 code.  

I also identified and made improvements to how text strings are stored in CircuitPython, reclaiming over 1kB of program space on the most resource constrained builds.  This may not sound like a lot in this era of terabyte hard drives, but on boards like the trinket_m0, we were down to under 100 bytes free!  

**Kattni**  
This week I published two guides I've been working on over the past few weeks: the [Adafruit Circuit Playground Tri-Color E-Ink Gizmo](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-tri-color-e-ink-gizmo) guide and the [Ultrasonic Sonar Distance Sensors](https://learn.adafruit.com/ultrasonic-sonar-distance-sensors) guide. In the land of code, I've been working on adding animations to the Adafruit CircuitPython LED Animations library, which will make it super easy to include a few animations in your code. So far we have color cycle, blink, solid, comet and sparkle. The reason I added those animations is my Circuit Playground Bluefruit project which lets you control color and animations on another CPB using the accelerometer and the buttons. I'll be putting it together with something festive for the season, and writing up a guide to go with it. Keep an eye out for that soon!

**Lucian**  
Last week I was out for Thanksgiving in NYC (the Brooklyn botanical gardens are extra cool in the winter, by the way) but there was nevertheless a small flurry of cleanup work around the edges of the holiday. I've been working on support for the PYB Nano, a small form factor STM32 board similar to the pyboard, as well as a generic STM32F411 "blackpill" breakout and the Meowbit. I've also hunted down some persistent bugs with the Neopixel and Displayio, which should make adding these new boards more straightforward and functional out of the box. This coming week, I'll be working on finalizing the new board packages, and hopefully working on some long delayed refactors of MCU package and internal flash management. 

**Melissa**  

[![melissa](../assets/12102019/121019melissa.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This week started off with a bunch additions to Blinka, the CircuitPython compatibility layer for Raspberry Pi and other Single Board Computers. I added support for enabling additional I2C ports on the Raspberry Pi 4 that used the same pins. Later, that same days a bunch of community Pull Requests for Blinka to add support for a number of boards. After reviewing and merging this in, I added 11 more boards under the Blinka section of [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org).  

Next I finished reviewing a PR for Python PureIO and while I was in there, updated the repository to support automatic versioning. Then I jumped back to displays and added a rotation parameter for the TFT Gizmo, cleaned up the code a bit, and then moved on to the IS31FL3731 to add some Pillow examples to it. As I started working on adding an example, I noticed there was no convenient way of adding images over, which was necessary for Pillow support and added that functionality. Additionally, because the display is such low resolution, some of the examples for other displays just wouldn’t work for this display.  

I wrote an example that displays text in each of the frames, wrote a small animated gif player that loads the animated gif’s frames into each of the frames and animates it, and finally finished off with a scrolling text marquee example. Now that the examples have been added, I’ll be working on updating some related guides. Also coming up, I’ll be helping out John Park with a cool Bluefruit project.  

**Scott**  
Last week I polished up the Apple Notification Center Service code and checked it into the library. I also prepped a demo for John Park that shows the icon of the app for the latest notification.  

Once that was done I circled back to debugging BLE keyboard support with iOS and managed to fix it. I also merged the helpful debugging output into CircuitPython.  

Next, I added support to the BLE library for the Magic Light bulb which is an RGB LED that can be changed over bluetooth. When doing so, I ran into a crash that Kattni had been seeing and managed to fix it.  

Lastly, I started working on a native PacketBuffer that can be used for BLE MIDI and the BLE Apple Media Service (to see what song is playing.) This work will also add support for negotiating BLE parameters for increasing speed and throughput. Stay tuned!  

## Upcoming events!

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/12102019/121019codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
