## The Top Programming Languages 2019 - Python tops the charts with a CircuitPython nod!

[![Python tops](../assets/09102019/91019python1.jpg)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-top-programming-languages-2019)

Python comes in #1 with a nod to Python on hardware! - [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-top-programming-languages-2019).

>_"Python is having an impact that could not have been anticipated when the language was first released in 1991. The dramatic increase in computing power found in microcontrollers means that embedded versions of Python, such as CircuitPython and MicroPython, are becoming increasingly popular among makers."_

## CircuitPython 5.0.0 Alpha 2 Released!

[![CircuitPython 5.0.0 Alpha 2 Released](../assets/09102019/91019poster.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/09/04/circuitpython-5-0-0-alpha-2-released/)

This is the second alpha release of CircuitPython 5.0.0. Alpha releases are meant for testing. Use the latest stable 4.x release when first starting with CircuitPython - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/09/04/circuitpython-5-0-0-alpha-2-released/).

## Machine Learning with Microcontrollers Hack Chat

[![Machine Learning with Microcontrollers Hack Chat](../assets/09102019/91019MachineLearningMCUsPosterV4.jpg)](https://hackaday.io/messages/room/2369)

"Ladyada" Fried and pt will host the Hack Chat on Wednesday, September 11, 2019 at noon PDT / 3PM EDT - [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2019/09/09/machine-learning-with-microcontrollers-hack-chat/).

[Click here](https://hackaday.io/messages/room/2369) to join - [hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/messages/room/2369)

We've gotten to the point where a $35 Raspberry Pi can be a reasonable alternative to a traditional desktop or laptop, and microcontrollers in the Arduino ecosystem are getting powerful enough to handle some remarkably demanding computational jobs. But there's still one area where microcontrollers seem to be lagging a bit: machine learning. Sure, there are purpose-built edge-computing SBCs, but wouldn't it be great to be able to run AI models on versatile and ubiquitous MCUs that you can pick up for a couple of bucks? 

We're moving in that direction, and our friends at Adafruit Industries want to stop by the Hack Chat and tell us all about what they're working on. In addition to Ladyada and PT, we'll be joined by Meghna Natraj, Daniel Situnayake, and Pete Warden, all from the Google TensorFlow team. If you've got any interest in edge computing on small form-factor computers, you won't want to miss this chat. Join us, ask your questions about TensorFlow Lite and TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers, and see what's possible in machine learning way out on the edge.

## What's the CircuitPython team up to this week?

Each week we have a mini-update on what the team is working on, here is what's cookin' this week!


**Bryan**

[![Bryan](../assets/09102019/91019bryan.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

>_"Earlier week I finished on the TVL493D and Airlift Bitsy Add-on guides. Next up I'm assembling, testing and getting started on the drivers for the PCT2075. This is an inexpensive I2C temperature sensor and "thermal watchdog". This means that in addition to getting the temperature you can ask it to tell you when the temperature has gone above or below a temperature that you choose."_

**Dan**

>_"CircuitPython BLE HID devices (mouse, keyboard, etc.) are now working on iOS. Thanks to our resident BLE and HID expert Thach, who figured out the issue. I prepared and released CircuitPython, 5.0.0-alpha.1, the first release for major version 5 of CircuitPython. This release also includes support for monochrome and ePaper displays done by Scott, among many other fixes and additions. Check out the release notes and try it out! I fixed an odd problem with CircuitPython DotStar colors on the PyRuler. Sometimes we buy a new batch of a supposedly identical product, and it's not quite the same as before. :) This week I'm working on adding bonding support to BLE. Bonding remembers pairing information so you don't have to re-pair every time."_

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/09102019/91019jeff.gif)](https://www.circuitpython.org)

>_"Hello from Nebraska!  I'm Jeff (@jepler on discord and GitHub) and this is my first time writing for the Python on Hardware newsletter.  I am working on the CircuitPython core. I continue to amass audio breakout boards, since audio has been the main aspect of my work on the core so far.  My current project is to implement I2SOut for nRF boards like the Circuit Playground Bluefruit.  While the PWM audio out I implemented this summer is okay, the quality is limited to 8 bits.  With I2SOut, you will also be able to do 16 bit audio for CD-like audio quality. Image shows various audio breakouts around a central breadboard, with tools and equipment also visible.  An nRF feather is running a PDMIn sound level demo adapted from Circuit Playground Express."_

**Kattni**

[![Kattni](../assets/09102019/91019kattni.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries/contributing)

>_"This week I've been working on product guides. I added the new JST breakout and a CircuitPython example to the PDM Microphone Breakout guide, and wrote up the new guide for the ATECC608. We began working towards updating [this guide](https://circuitpython.org/libraries/contributing) so we have a better way to track open issues and pull requests across all of the library GitHub repositories. I've started working on the massive guide for the Circuit Playground Bluefruit, our latest Circuit Playground board. It'll have all the details about the new board, including pinouts and a guided tour. Look for it soon!"_

**Lucian**

>_"Hello from the Artisans Asylum of Boston! I'm Lucian (@hierophect), and this is also my first time in the Python for Hardware newsletter. I am developing for the STM32 port of CircuitPython, and related functionality. I am working to expand the functionality of CircuitPython across ST's Discovery line of development boards, starting with expanded module support for AnalogIO and BusIO, as well as adding QSPI Flash support for the discovery boards that include it. I'll also be working on standardizing support across the F411, F412, and F405 MCUs to support a wider variety of both ST and third party STM32 breakouts and development modules."_

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/09102019/91019helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
