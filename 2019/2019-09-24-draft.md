## Max Holiday - CircuitPython in space, SmallSats and more!

[![Max in space](../assets/09242019/92419space.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Mb9c4e7ID9E)

[Max Holiday](https://github.com/maholli) has been Integrating CircuitPython into many aspects of his PhD research at Stanford University, we had a great time together chatting ([video](https://youtu.be/Mb9c4e7ID9E)), thank you [Max](https://twitter.com/maholli404)! Topics included:

[![PyCubed](../assets/09242019/92419pycubed.jpg)](http://pycubed.org/)

[KickSat-2](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/kicksat/) development yielded the [PyCubed project](http://pycubed.org/) and after Max's talk at SmallSat 2019 over 60 universities have reached out wanting to use and/or incorporate PyCubed into the Cubesat development efforts.

[![KickSat](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/03/python_in_space.gif)](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/kicksat/)

All of the radiation testing, data collection, etc ... for the research is collected using CircuitPython.

[![SX1280](../assets/09242019/92419sx1280.jpg)](https://github.com/maholli/sx1280-breakout)

[![SX1280](../assets/09242019/92419sx1280_on_adafruit.jpg)](https://github.com/maholli/sx1280-breakout)

Max is really excited lately with the time-of-flight ranging capability of the Semtech SX1280 radios. So Max [built a breakout](https://github.com/maholli/sx1280-breakout) that fits existing HopeRF footprints and published a working (albeit rough around the edges) [CircuitPython library](https://github.com/maholli/CircuitPython_SX1280)! ![Keysight](file://localhost/tmp/keysight.jpg) 

[![Keysight](../assets/09242019/92419keysight.jpg)](https://www.iotchallengekeysight.com/)

Max was in NYC for this [Keysight IoT competition](https://www.iotchallengekeysight.com/). Using the KickSat-2 CircuitPython platform (the small form-factor sprites), Max's team worked with a chemical engineering group at Stanford to develop a [completely new means of measuring ammonia concentrations in water](https://www.iotchallengekeysight.com/2019/entries/smart-water/257-0515-132058-immersible-internet-of-things-iot-sensors-for-cloud-based-water-quality-monitoring). The mesh network: gateways, sensing nodes, etc… are all using CircuitPython.

Max's contributions to the maker community and Stanford curriculum include:

[![SAM32](../assets/09242019/92419sam32.jpg)](https://www.notion.so/SAM32-Guides-6b7e8ca318ff49418eec16e975d98f5d)

Max developed the [SAM32 board](https://www.notion.so/SAM32-Guides-6b7e8ca318ff49418eec16e975d98f5d) as a “catch-all” or swiss-army knife for student projects, it's is now part the curriculum in 5+ courses in the fall. 

[![MEMs](../assets/09242019/92419e240.jpg)](https://www.notion.so/SAM32-Guides-6b7e8ca318ff49418eec16e975d98f5d)

One example, Eng240, is a MEMS course that’s historically been purely theory-based. However, Prof. Roger Howe and Max have overhauled the class to include labs in the fall. The first of which have students assembling their own SAM32, the second has students designing their own “marco” accelerometer using PCBs. Everything is driven with CircuitPython. 

[![Soldering](../assets/09242019/92419solder01.jpg)](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/soldering-internal/learning)

[![Soldering](../assets/09242019/92419solder02.jpg)](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/soldering-internal/learning)

Max is a self described soldering nerd - and was completely dissatisfied with resources online for folks learning to solder. [Max made a very polished tutorial](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/soldering-internal/learning) with a self-assessment quiz. Then coupled it with a soldering practice + exam board for Stanford students to use. 

## Program CircuitPython devices with iPhone & iOS 13

[![CPiOS](../assets/09242019/92419cirpy-plus-iphone-1.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/09/19/program-circuitpython-devices-with-iphone-ios-13/)

With the launch of iOS 13, iPhone users now have the ability to edit code on CircuitPython USB devices! Once you’re device is updated, you can connect a board such as Circuit Playground Express and edit & run code on the go - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/09/19/program-circuitpython-devices-with-iphone-ios-13/).

## CircuitPython snakes its way to FT232H

[![FT232H](../assets/09242019/92419ft23h.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rriKd9jkdJQ)

The FT232H is a handy USB to gpio/i2c/spi breakout board we’ve stocked for a long time. It is used by lots of folks as a hardware interfacing bridge. For a long time we’ve had Python support for it but that support has gotten kinda old and neglected as we’ve spent a lot of our efforts on CircuitPython. Well, now we have CircuitPython Blinka support, so you can control sensors, oleds, buttons, LEDs and more all via FT232H! All thanks to Carter who fearlessly took on this code support – we’ll start writing up a guide in the next week or two - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/rriKd9jkdJQ).

[![IFTTT CircuitPython](../assets/09242019/92419ifttcphs02.jpg)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/23)

[Issue 23 – HackSpace magazine: Send data with If This Then That - Control almost anything with CircuitPython by Ben Everard](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/23) -

> _"If This Then That (IFTTT) is a really simple bit of glue that lets you link a condition with an action, both of which are taken from web services. All IFTTT applets are in the format If ‘condition’ then ‘action’. This simple form is surprisingly powerful because it’s linked to a huge number of internet services and web-connected devices. The sheer range of services that can link together, and the fact that everything can be configured by clicking on things in a website, make it a great platform for basic Internet of Things devices and experiments."_

## Motorized wing, making your cosplay move

[![Motorized wing](../assets/09242019/92419motwingcphs01.jpg)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/23)

[![Motorized wing](../assets/09242019/92419motwingcphs02.jpg)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/23)

[Issue 23 – HackSpace magazine: Motorized wing, making your cosplay move, add a servo for breathtaking effects](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/23) by Sophy Wong -

>_“Add movement to your cosplay with a servo motor! In this intermediate build, we’ll make an articulating wing that opens and closes at the touch of a finger. This project is a perfect add-on to a sci-fi robot costume, a steampunk aviator, or any costume with a shoulder pauldron. We’ll bring our wing to life with some crafting, soldering, and a little bit of code! We’ve kept this build simple with everyday materials like cardboard and string. Clean, used shipping boxes are a great source of 4mm corrugated cardboard. A laser cutter makes quick work of cutting out the wings, but if you don’t have access to one, use scissors or a craft knife to cut the cardboard by hand. Our cyberpunk-style wing template includes design lines that can be engraved or traced on the surface of the wing for more texture. Download our template at [hsmag.cc/issue23](http://hsmag.cc/issue23), or create your own custom wing shape from scratch. Just make sure the pivoting side of the wing is a nice, round circle, for smooth movement. Once cut, paint the wings to match your costume – a coat of silver spray paint made our cardboard shine bright.”_

## Adafruit Feather takes flight with the SparkFun Thing Plus Artemis

[![Adafruit Feather takes flight with the SparkFun Thing Plus](../assets/09242019/92419artemis.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/09/19/adafruit-feather-takes-flight-with-the-sparkfun-thing-plus-artemis-sparkfun-adafruit/)

Adafruit Feather takes flight with the [SparkFun Thing Plus - Artemis](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15574). AND! It appears CircuitPython support is _"a topic of discussion for sure"_! - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sparkfun/status/1175099450072666113).

The latest SparkFun board is Feather-compatible! [This is the fifth](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/feather) SparkFun Adafruit Feather-compatible board (not including the Particle boards which are Feather format as well).

>_"To make the Thing Plus even easier to use, we've moved a few pins around to make the board Feather compatible..."_

[![Awesome Feather](../assets/09242019/92419feathers.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-feather/)

Feather is a complete line of development boards that are both standalone and stackable. They’re able to be powered by LiPo batteries for on-the-go use or by their micro-USB plugs for stationary projects. Feathers are flexible, portable, and as light as their namesake. FeatherWings are stacking boards and add functionality and room for prototyping. At its core, Feather is a complete ecosystem of products – and the best way to get your project flying.

The Feathers at Adafruit are open source. Adafruit encourages other companies to utilize this form factor to maximize compatibility with dozens of pre-existing boards.

Check out awesome-feather for a complete list! - [github.com/adafruit/awesome-feather](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-feather/).

>_"This week I finished up and released the SSD1305 framebuf driver to be used with the upcoming Large OLED Bonnet. If I may say so myself, it looks great! I also assembled and started working on the driver for the upcoming MPU-6050 STEMMA QT compatible 6-axis Accelerometer and Gyroscope."_

**Jepler**

[![Jepler](../assets/09242019/92419jepler.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

>_"This week, my main work was more research about DAC issues on the boards with samd51 microcontrollers, like the Metro M4 Express.  A pull request improved various problems when the DACs were used for simple analog out or audio out, but some strange behavior remains where high amplitude square waves are concerned.  I personally suspect there might be gremlins in the silicon at this point. Along the way, I learned how to use my scope's pass/fail mode to record how often an anomaly occurred when looping a short sample via CircuitPython's AudioOut.  Answer: Less than 0.5% of the time in this test, after employing a workaround."_

**Kattni**

>_"The Circuit Playground Bluefruit guide has been published! I found a number of bugs during testing, and we've since fixed them all. This week, I'm working on the Hallowing M4 guide. If you're looking for how to get going with your Hallowing M4, keep an eye out for that to be published soon! After that, I'll be adding three Bluetooth examples to the Circuit Playground Bluefruit guide. They'll provide a starting point for using CircuitPython with the Bluetooth features of your CPB!"_

**Lucian**

>_"We just wrapped up AnalogIO for the STM32 today after getting held up by some tricky bugs. Now that that's completed, I'll be moving on to expanding the implementation of I2C and the rest of BusIO using a new implementation of peripherals specific to the STM32. This will enable a bunch of new modules and breakout boards to be used with circuitpython! I'll also be working on support for new F4 dev boards."_

**Melissa**

>_"Just finished up writing a learn guide for a new utility called CircUp that allows easy maintenance of CircuitPython libraries across your devices. You can check out the learn guide [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/keep-your-circuitpython-libraries-on-devices-up-to-date-with-circup). I've gone through the displayio examples making some minor updates and updated the corresponding CircuitPython displayio learn guide pages. I've also been adding several new boards to the circuitpython.org website under the Downloads page. I took the Arduino ST7735 Library and split up the graphicstest example into 4 different examples so it would be easier to follow along with newer boards such as the HalloWing M4. I also fixed a bug in the CircuitPython Seesaw library that wasn't allowing the NeoTrellis and MiniTFT boards to work correctly on the latest versions of CircuitPython. Now I'm working on going through updating the monochrome OLED learn guide pages to reflect some of the recently added displayio drivers."_
