## MicroPython turning 6 next week

[![April 29](../assets/04232019/42319mpbd.jpg)](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1116333147468255232)

Next week is MicroPython's 6th birthday, there was some debate about which day in April is the birthday day, so we asked the creator Damien George and we have the official dates.

- 29th April 2013: first line of code written (in private, before anyone knew about it, before it was even called Micro-Python)
- 17th Sept 2013: first code running on a microcontroller, on the very first prototype of the pyboard
- 2nd Oct 2013: register micropython.org
- 4th Oct 2013: first commit in what is now the main repository
- late Dec 2013: source code up on GitHub
- 21st June 2014: last of the Kickstarter rewards sent out (for the first Kickstarter)

Happy Birthday MicroPython!

## Upcoming events!

[![KiCon](../assets/04232019/42319kicon.png)](https://www.kicad-kicon.com)

Happening April 26th and 27th 2019 in Chicago IL, this will be the first and largest gathering of hardware developers using KiCad. Talks at the conference will span hardware design, revision control, scripting, manufacturing considerations, proper library management and getting  started developing the underlying tools. All talks have been listed on the conference site. Additionally, there will be contests, roundtable discussions with the developers and hands-on demos to deepen knowledge of hardware design and using KiCad.

Is this a conference only for current users of KiCad? No! Attendees will learn general concepts around PCB design, hardware creation and developing products for the market. Attendees include hardware and software developers from around the world, including members of the core KiCad development team out of CERN in Switzerland.

PyCon AU has recently announced their [Call for Proposals](https://2019.pycon-au.org/speak/).

## Digi-Key + Adafruit @ PyCon!

[![PyCon](../assets/04232019/42319pycon.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

PyCon 2019 returns May 1–9, 2019 to Cleveland, OH – with talks, tutorials, sprints, and more!

Big news! Digi-Key and Adafruit have teamed up for PyCon 2019 so every attendee (about 4,000!) will receive a [SPECIAL EDITION Circuit Playground Express](https://youtu.be/ZMx6qB-7z9U), running … CircuitPython.

This effort is to get Python on hardware to the most folks out there, at the events that bring people together.

This is just one of many efforts we’re teaming up with Digi-Key to continue to fuel all the developers from beginners to pro, using Python on microcontrollers.

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!

The PyCon 2019 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.

Scott will be leading a talk at the **Python Language Summit, History of CircuitPython**. The Python Language Summit is an event for the developers of Python implementations (CPython, PyPy, Jython, and so on) to share information, discuss our shared problems, and — hopefully — solve them - [pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit](https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/)

We will have a lot more updates, stay tuned to the [Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit), [Discord](http://adafru.it/discord), and more!

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello World](../assets/04232019/42319hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
