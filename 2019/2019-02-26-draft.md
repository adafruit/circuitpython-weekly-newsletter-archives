## Digi-Key + Adafruit @ PyCon!

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/22619pycon01.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

PyCon 2019 returns May 1–9, 2019 to Cleveland, OH – with talks, tutorials, sprints, and more! 

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/22619pyconDigi-Key.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

Big news! Digi-Key and Adafruit have teamed up for PyCon 2019 so every attendee (about 4,000!) will receive a [SPECIAL EDITION Circuit Playground Express](https://youtu.be/ZMx6qB-7z9U), running … CircuitPython.

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/22619pyconboards.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

This effort is to get Python on hardware to the most folks out there, at the events that bring people together.

This is just one of many efforts we’re teaming up with Digi-Key to continue to fuel all the developers from beginners to pro, using Python on microcontrollers.

[![PyCon]({{ "/assets/22619pyconteam.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/)

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!

The PyCon 2019 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.

We will have a lot more updates, stay tuned to the [Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit), [Discord](http://adafru.it/discord), and more!

## Python on Hardware Means Choices for Makers

From Apress ["Python on Hardware Means Choices for Makers"](https://www.apress.com/us/blog/all-blog-posts/python-on-hardware-means-choices-for-makers/16332230) by Liz Clark. From the article:

*Python has also been ported to microcontrollers (MCUs), with popular choices being MicroPython and, now, CircuitPython (a fork of MicroPython that is designed from the ground up to be beginner friendly.) This allows end users to use Python for their electronics hardware projects similar to how they may have used C/C++ with the Arduino IDE. This brings the same benefits from the Python programmer side of things to the maker community in an even more dramatic way. Blinking an LED is considered to be the electronic community’s “hello world” equivalent. This can be achieved in CircuitPython with a couple of lines of code that are straightforward and easy to read, making the barrier to entry for beginners to both hardware and software much lower.*

## 5,000 Thanks to all our readers & contributors, and community! 

[![5,000 thanks]({{ "/assets/226195000thanks.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/24/5000-thanks-python-on-microcontrollers-our-fastest-growing-newsletter-featuring-circuitpython-micropython-python-on-hardware-raspberry-pi-and-more-adafruit-circuitpython-micropython-raspb/)

Thank you so much, all 5,000 of you! [The Python on Micrcontrollers newsletter at Adafruitdaily.com](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/) reached over 5,000 subscribers last week. Thank you to the community, the readers, the contributors, and the teams that make this [spam-free, privacy-respecting](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/about/), excellent resource, available to so many people each and every week. 

We started the newsletter 2 years ago, and in April of 2018 we really focused on bringing all thing Python on hardware together and it's become our fastest growing newsletter month over month! 

One of the reasons is the activity and sharing in the Python community, which is amplified when you bring all the fun and projects with electronics together. Each week it's becoming a challenge to keep up with all the projects from the community, news, new devices ... and that is an excellent "problem" to have! A newsletter, a site, an event, is a reflection of a community and we're so happy with all the people coming together who like to code, and like to make & share things. 

It's hard to pick one big news event or community project over the last couple years, however - here's a list of things that really shined brightly in the last few months.

[![Stress Management Mask]({{ "/assets/22619stress.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/seantibor/stressmanagementmask)

Stress Management Mask by Dilnaam D. - A prototype of a mask to manage stress using Python and a CircuitPlayground Express - [GitHub](https://github.com/seantibor/stressmanagementmask). *This mask was made to demonstrate how a CircuitPlayground Express could be used to measure body temperature and indicate stress levels. My theory is that body temperature is an indicator of stressful feelings and that people can better control their stress when they have a visual indication of their own stress state.* - [Made with Mu](http://madewith.mu/mu/users/2019/02/25/stress-management-mask.html).

What is Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy.

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world]({{ "/assets/22619hello.jpg" | absolute_url }}){:width="550px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
