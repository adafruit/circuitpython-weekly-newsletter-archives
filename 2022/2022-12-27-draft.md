Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! We're almost to a new year! Lots of content this week. Plus see my editorial note below. Thank you for your subscription! - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 6 Released

[![CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 6 Released](../assets/20221227/20221227cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/12/21/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-6-released/)

CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.6 has been released. It is relatively stable, but there will be further additions, fixes, and changes before final release.

NOTE: The file for specifying startup values for WiFi, etc. is now called settings.toml instead of .env, and uses slightly different syntax. Use double quotes instead of single quotes. Further documentation is here - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/12/21/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-6-released/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.0.0-beta.6).

## TinyUSB Adds BitBang USB Host Support for Raspberry Pi RP2040

[![TinyUSB Adds USB Host Support](../assets/20221227/20221227usb.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/12/22/rp2040-programming-an-rp2040-flash-inception/)

Many microcontrollers have USB device support but few have USB host support. This week, Adafruit and TinyUSB announced that USB host support has been added to the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller. Host support uses the RP2040 PIO (programmable input/output) peripheral to implement a host USB peripheral on a set of GPIO pins. The regular USB peripheral connection still works as before. Currently host CDC (serial) and MSC (mass storage) are supported. RP2040 USB host support is limited to Arduino at the moment but hopefully Python support will be forthcoming - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/12/22/rp2040-programming-an-rp2040-flash-inception/), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/sjl7aVK2Q2U) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TinyUSB_Arduino/tree/master/examples/DualRole).

## Coming Up: CircuitPython 2023

## Thank You, Readers

[![Thank You](../assets/20221227/20221227thanks.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Thank you to all our readers for a wonderful year! I set the goal of over 10,000 subscribers a week, a number we surpassed a few weeks ago. I look to find some of the best information on using Python on microcontrollers and single board computers (SBC) each week. The industry is thriving, so filling a weekly newsletter is easier than ever. 2023 looks especially bright with advances in RISC-V, the chip shortages easing and the proliferation of open source software. I look forward to seeing what's next - *Anne Barela, Editor*

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.6 on Wednesday 12/21. This release includes the change from .env to settings.toml, and a rework of the coprocessor API, more specialized for the Espressif ULP (ultra low power) RISC-V coprocessor.

I fixed several miscellaneous problems for this release, including a crash only when running debug builds on Cortex-M4. That turned out to be an obscure compiler-related issue: tracking it down involved looking at the generated assembly code. I discovered I had fixed more or less the same problem five years ago (!), but it reappeared.

We now have only five or six remaining issues to resolve for CircuitPython 8.0.0 final. I'm looking forward to seeing 8.0.0 in general release.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Scrolling Countdown Timer](https://learn.adafruit.com/scrolling-countdown-timer) guide. This was a collaboration with [Liz](https://learn.adafruit.com/u/BlitzCityDIY) and [Noe](https://learn.adafruit.com/u/pixil3d). It walks you through building a scrolling event countdown timer using three quad alphanumeric backpacks with displays, a QT Py ESP32-S2, and a 3D printed stand. The guide focusses on the countdown to Christmas, but you can easily edit the code to countdown to anything! Check it out!

As 2022 comes to an end, I want to say thank you to everyone in our community, to the folks who read my guides, and to all who contribute to the CircuitPython project in all ways, big and small. Code + Community = CircuitPython. Without our community, CircuitPython wouldn't be close to what it is. I greatly appreciate all of you. Have a wonderful holiday or time off, and a wonderful start to 2023!

This past week I worked on adding some finishing touches to [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org/). Due to the holidays, the changes likely won't be merged in until the beginning of next year because the person I would like to take a look is taking time off. In the mean time, I plan to turn my focus to the main [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/) website.

**Tim**

This week I tested and reviewed various library PRs. Including some to add multi-handler functionality to Logger objects and a new example for outputting logs to Adafruit.io via MQTT connection. This can provide some helpful troubleshooting output for IoT devices that are inconvenient to plug in for serial debugging. 

**Jeff**

I've been on a lighter schedule for the holidays, but I did update the NeXT keyboard guide to add support for the NeXT mouse, which can be daisy chained through the keyboard. Check out the updated guide.

**Liz**

This week I worked on the [NeoPixel Sprite Weather Display project](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixel-sprite-weather-display). It uses a QT Py ESP32-S2 with a 5x5 NeoPixel Grid BFF to display weather sprites and scroll text to display the current temperature. It uses the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en) to grab weather data. I wanted to do a project with this API since it is open-source and doesn't require an API key.

I will be out for the next two weeks to recharge for the new year. I'm looking forward to working on and sharing more awesome projects in 2023!
