[![CircuitPython at PyCon](../assets/20220419/20220419adapc.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/18/looking-forward-to-pycon-2022-python-pyconus-pycon/)

PyCon 2022 is coming right up from April 27, 2022 – May 3, 2022, which includes the pre-conference Summits, the conference itself, and the Sprints following the conference. Kattni, Melissa and Jeff from Adafruit will be attending this year.

Kattni and Melissa will be attending the Education Summit on April 28th. Kattni will be giving a talk at the Summit called _Simplicity and Fun: Learning with CircuitPython_. The team will also be hosting a _Welcome to CircuitPython_ mini-sprint.

Kattni, Melissa and Jeff will be attending the conference April 29th through May 1st. They will be hosting Open Spaces every day (time TBD), which will be an introduction to CircuitPython using the Circuit Playground Bluefruit (CPB). The Bluefruits will be provided, along with a few other accessories, to enable folks to explore CircuitPython. A quick-start will be available to help you get started, as well as a series of other examples to delve into. All three of us will be available to help.

Kattni and Melissa will be hosting development Sprints May 2nd and 3rd. This will be two days of helping folks contribute to CircuitPython. There are many GitHub issues available to choose from as a place to get started. Hardware will be available for a significant number of the libraries, so folks will be able to test any library code they intend to contribute. There are plenty of options including bug fixes, library enhancements, and documentation. As well, if you’re new to CircuitPython, we’ll be happy to accommodate that as well.

All relevant content, including slides, the quick-start, and example code, will be available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kattni/PyCon2022) - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/18/looking-forward-to-pycon-2022-python-pyconus-pycon/).

Check it out and follow now to be notified of future streams - [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/tammymakesthings).

## Project of the Week: Testing Math Precision

Doing math operations on microcontrollers, which most often used fixed bit lengths to represent numbers, can result in rounding errors - decimal numbers that are close to the result but not quite right. Twitter user [Hide_G](https://twitter.com/JP_Hide_G/status/1514960069167042568) took a look at various Python implementations to check this out.

[![Python](../assets/20220419/20220419python.jpg)](https://twitter.com/JP_Hide_G/status/1514960069167042568)

First tested was CPython (standard Python) 3.10.4 and there was a wrong value - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JP_Hide_G/status/1514960069167042568).

[![MicroPython](../assets/20220419/20220419micropython.jpg)](https://twitter.com/JP_Hide_G/status/1514960069167042568)

Second was MicroPython 1.17 and there was a value issue with many operations - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JP_Hide_G/status/1514979190827020289).

[![CircuitPython](../assets/20220419/20220419circuitpython.jpg)](https://twitter.com/JP_Hide_G/status/1514960069167042568)

Last was CircuitPython and while all the values checked out, it wasn't a good result - it's just an artifact of how CircuitPython prints numbers that makes it look correct! - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JP_Hide_G/status/1515000067136327683).

**How to remedy this??**

[![uDecimal for CircuitPython](../assets/20220419/20220419jepler.jpg)](https://jepler-udecimal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

The answer is to use numbers that preserve precision (the [decimal module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html) in CPython). For microcontrollers and CircuitPython, there is a [uDecimal library by Jeff Epler](https://jepler-udecimal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) that gives the correct mathematical answers. If you need accuracy, check it out.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I am working on a number of issues to improve CircuitPython reliability:

- NeoPixel timing on SAMD51 and possibly some other chip families could use tuning. Sometimes the first NeoPixel in a string gets the wrong color. There are multiple parts used for NeoPixels: WS2811, WS2812B, SK6812, and perhaps some others. They have slightly different timing requirements. Each NeoPixel regenerates the timing when passing on data on its output line, so we can observe the timings each kind of NeoPixel likes best. I am measuring the timings on multiple kinds of NeoPixels with my Saleae, adjusting the delays, and re-testing.
- ESP2-S2 I2C is showing long delays (10ms) between transactions, but only at 100 kHz I2C bus speed. Increasing the speed even only slightly removes the long delay. The delay seems related to the FreeRTOS tick interval used in the ESP-IDF.
- ESP32SPI WiFi can fail after a few minutes of intense use when used with the `PortalBase` library. It does not appear that that the library is doing anything wrong, but it is more complicated that using the base ESP32SPI library, which does not fail after many hours of trials. We need to figure out what is different about how the libraries are doing WiFi.

I wrote a visualization tool that shows the information stored on a floppy disk. It can be a tool to help understand, at a high level, the structure of floppy disk formats. This image shows a Commodore 1541 floppy disk image, as mastered by fluxengine. You can check out the software (on GitHub)[https://github.com/adafruit/fluxvis] or (on pypi)[https://pypi.org/project/fluxvis/].

**Kattni**

This week I finished up the `asyncio` template and deployed it into the Feather ESP32-S2 guide. I published the QT Py Charger BFF guide. I updated a few miscellaneous things that needed updating - board revisions, etc. And finally, I finished up the Feather ESP32-S3 guide. It's almost identical to the Feather ESP32-S2 guide, with a few tweaks to the Pinouts page and a couple of Arduino pages, and additional information added to the Downloads page.

This past week, I finally had my changes to make use of LittleFS and ESPtool as NPM packages updated in the [WipperSnapper Firmware Uploader](https://adafruit.github.io/WipperSnapper_Firmware_Uploader/). This tools will eventually be integrated into the [Adafruit IO dashboard](https://io.adafruit.com/) itself and this change was an important step in that it cleaned up a lot of the code and also showed proper implementation and tested that it worked.

I also started working on implementing a new MIPI driver for Raspberry Pi Displays. The current FBTFT driver has had issues with each new release of Raspberry Pi OS and this will allow for a more universal driver that should be more stable.

I continued my tinkering with "inflated" TileGrids from last week. These will allow us to use small 3x3 spritesheets and generate larger sized TileGrids from them by repeating the middle row and column tiles as needed to reach the desired size. The initial use-case I have in mind for this is a new TabLayout displayio widget but I think the functionality will end up having many other nifty uses for displayio based graphics. 

As part of my work on this, I dove into the core code for TileGrid and started working on an enhancement to allow the bitmap to be changed after the TileGrid is created, in the TabLayout this will be used to visually differentiate "active" and "inactive" tabs. This week we're having a CircuitPython Library focused edition of the Deep Dive stream, we'll be joined by special guest Kattni to discuss all things related to Library development.

This past week I wrapped up the Doomscroll and Chill - A Wireless BLE Scroll Wheel Remote Learn Guide. I think folks will find it to be a good resource for using the scroll wheel as an HID shortcut interface. Next, I will be working on a controller for the classic game Glider. It will involve an actual paper airplane. I'm also going to begin exploring laser harps.
