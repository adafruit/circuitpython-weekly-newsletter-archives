Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter for February, 22, 2022 or 2-2-22 for those folks who like numbers.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## 256 CircuitPython Boards and More

[![256 CircuitPython Boards](../assets/20220222/20220222-256.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

A milestone achieved and passed - 256 boards running CircuitPython. Why celebrate at 256? That's one more than fits in an 8-bit value (0-255) so we're celebrating 0b100000000 boards!

[![256 CircuitPython Boards](../assets/20220222/20220222cc.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

Did you know that not all CircuitPython boards are made by Adafruit? Not by a long stretch! SparkFun has fifteen boards, Pimoroni has nine, and so many more. CircuitPython is an open source language which any hardware designer may look to use.

## Python Software Foundation News

[![PSF](../assets/20220222/20220222psf.jpg)](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/02/we-are-hiring-contract-developers-to.html)

The Python Software Foundation has funding available for designing, developing and deploying organization accounts in PyPI - [PSF Blog](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/02/we-are-hiring-contract-developers-to.html).

> PyPI is the official repository of Python packages. PyPI allows users to search for packages, publish and distribute packages. The aim of this project is to allow PyPI users to set up an organization account, invite other users to join, organize those users into teams, and manage ownership and permissions across multiple projects. We hope to provide organization accounts as a paid service to companies and complimentary access to community projects. The organization account feature will provide the structure based on which new features can be offered to paying customers.You can read this post that summarizes the user surveys.

They hope to hire two contractors who will code, test, review, document and deploy the organization account features. The two contractors include one backend developer and one frontend developer. The solicitaion is now open and it closed March 4th.

**What is PyPI (pip)?**

## Project of the Week

[![PyPortal Zabbix](../assets/20220222/20220222pyp.gif)](https://github.com/strlng/pyportal-zabbix-problems)

[Zabbix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabbix) is an open-source monitoring software tool to monitor IT infrastructure such as networks, servers, virtual machines (VMs) and cloud services. Zabbix collects and displays monitoring metrics such as CPU, memory, and network load.

Sterling Anderson has developed a stand alone (no computer required) display for Zabbix data. It uses an [Adafruit Pyportal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116) programmed in CircuitPython to fetch data via WiFi and display it on a color LCD display. It is housed in a 3D printed case - [GitHub](https://github.com/strlng/pyportal-zabbix-problems).

Last week the CircuitPython team went over the open issues for 7.2.0 and 7.x.x, and did some triage. As of last Thursday, the team has fixed all the remaining 7.2.0 issues, and we are on track for a 7.2.0-rc.0 release.

I did some type annotation infrastructure work, moving `circuitpython_typing` out of `adafruit-blinka` and into its own library. A few type-annotated libraries then needed their dependencies updated. This was partly prelude for my continuing work on an asyncio-enabled HTTP requests library.

I finally got to do some heads-down work on CircuitPython this past week. MicroPython 1.18 was released on January 16, and now there's a Pull Request to merge it into CircuitPython. It doesn't bring any big user-visible changes, but we're always happy when we can keep up with the latest updates and bugfixes to the core. We owe a hearty thanks to the contributors to MicroPython. By my quick count, there were as many as 57 contributors to MicroPython between versions 1.17 and 1.18.

This week I published the ADXL375 guide, and updated the VEML7700 guide with the STEMMA QT rev. I got to dip my toes into code a bit with writing the ADXL37x library, and then adding the offsets feature and an example using it to the ADXL34x library. I am working on getting TFT and WiFi examples into the Feather TFT guide, so if you picked one up and have been waiting on these demos, keep an eye out for that update.

I also recorded my episode of the CircuitPython Show Podcast, which will be released on 1 March 2022, if all goes as planned. I had a lot of fun recording it, and got to share my story which I always enjoy doing. If you're interested in how I got into this whole thing in the first place, check it out!

This past week I worked on catching up with issues and pull requests that had been waiting for me on GitHub while I finished up the LittleFS project. One of the issues I found particularly perplexing is that on the 2.7" E-Ink displays in Arduino, it would invert the colors when a reset pin was used. The issue turned out to be a missing init code.

This week I finished up the PyPortal Winamp Player Learn Guide and recorded a short video introducing it. This guide has some code for the PyPortal as well as some CPython code that runs on your PC, I updated our project files screenshot utility to be able to omit the files used on the PC from the screenshot shown on the Learn Guide Pages. I also created a few basic displayio examples for the Feather TFT ESP32-S2. 

Thanks to some help from members of our community in the Discord (Neradoc and anecdata), we have narrowed down an issue with pulling data from a NASA API for the Webb Telescope to something resolved by a newer certificate. Next week, I'll be looking into how to update the certificates that CircuitPython uses by default.

This week I've been wrapping up the BLE work that I did for ESP32-S3. I added a PacketBuffer test example and a new native CircuitPython BroadcastNet bridge that should be simpler to keep running. The last outstanding PR is to get GATT client support into CircuitPython main. This will allow you to use CP with other devices and their data.

For most of the week I've been diving into using PIO for USB Host. I was perusing the USB 2.0 spec and learning about the various layers. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdgULBpRoXk) is a great video from Ben Eater about the USB encoding. I also got the demo code from https://github.com/sekigon-gonnoc/Pico-PIO-USB working. Now I'm working to integrate it into TinyUSB. I'm starting with timing the start of frame packets and then will integrate the other packets into the frame loop.
