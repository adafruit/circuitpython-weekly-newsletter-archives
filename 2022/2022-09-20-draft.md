Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! The development world finally has the long awaited Arduino development environment version 2. Will that be enough to entice devs away from easier to code languages like Python? A raft of podcasts celebrating making this week. And some very interesting projects and new hardware is featured. We hope you like this issue of the newsletter.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I've just added the ability to preserve the state of specified pins when entering deep sleep in CircuitPython. This is currently implemented on Espressif boards only.

I'm continuing to investigate and fix bugs for the 8.0.0 release.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [WiFi Mailbox Notifier guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/wifi-mailbox-notifier/overview)! This guide uses a CircuitPython, a Feather ESP32 V2, WiFi, and Adafruit IO to put together a project to install in your mailbox, that will email you every time the mailbox door is opened. The guide includes how to identify reed switch terminals (they can be very confusing!), soldering and assembly instructions, code walkthrough, Adafruit IO set up, installation and usage, and power analysis to verify your board is definitely entering deep sleep. The guide is great for the project, but also for the extra included info! Feel free to check it out!

**Melissa**

[![title](../assets/20220920/20220920melissa.gif)](url)

This past week I worked on adding a lot of improvements to the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/). These improvements included some code restructuring, bug fixes, an improved loading animation with a spinning Blinka, folder uploading and downloading into a zipped file, updating to the latest CodeMirror editor component, changing the filename color based on whether changes are saved, and showing more files and details. I'm hoping to get this project to a good stopping point very soon and will probably be getting to some move thorough testing in about a week.

**Tim**

This week I worked on "finishing touches" for the flip clock widget library. The core functionality is done and working but I've been adding docstrings and type annotations as well as more thorough example scripts. The last piece remaining that needs cleanup, docstrings, and type annotations is the PIL based script that runs on the PC to generate the sprite sheets. Once that one is finished up I'll make the PR to add this library to the bundle.

**Jeff**

I published a new guide this week: [Commodore Keyboard to USB HID with CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/commodore-keyboard-to-usb-hid-with-circuitpython/overview) -- In this guide, you will learn how to adapt a matrix-style keyboard from an iconic computer brand to a modern computer using CircuitPython and the KB2040 board.

**Liz**

This past week I wrote a [guide on plugging the new nOOds flexible LED filaments into CV (control voltage) synths](https://learn.adafruit.com/noods-led-synth-cv-visualizers). The nOOds light up depending on the voltage and waveform coming out of your synth. I'm hoping this will inspire folks to get creative with these new LEDs. If you want more info on them, be sure to check out [Phil B's amazing 
Überguide](https://learn.adafruit.com/noods-uberguide) that he did for them.

I also added a [page to the MacroPad guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-macropad-rp2040/attaching-external-hardware) on using external hardware with the board, such as a STEMMA board.
