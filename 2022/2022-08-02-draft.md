## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220802/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

This past week I debugged some ESP32SPI-related problems, which were due to MQTT timeouts and not handling certain exceptions. I revised a number of Learn Guide projects to fix these potential issues.

I've now gone back to working on the ESP32 port, and am currently debugging builds for boards with no PSRAM available.

**Jeff**

I handed back the ESP32 port to Dan so that I could finish up a guide called [Using QMK on RP2040 Microcontrollers](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-qmk-on-rp2040-microcontrollers). When I returned to CircuitPython land, I started working on some updates to the camera support on Espressif microcontrollers that has since turned into a full rewrite. We hope that when it's done, we'll be able to use a wider range of cameras on ESP32, ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3 boards with a new API.

**Kattni**

This was another short week for me. I focussed on getting the final WipperSnapper pages completed. Other than that, I finished up a bunch of miscellaneous items I had hanging around or recently assigned.

In CircuitPython Day news, I'm continuing to add more content. Next week I'll be spending more time on planning, and I'm hoping to have a tentative schedule available soon! Keep an eye on it [here](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/07/27/announcing-circuitpython-day-2022-on-august-19th-circuitpythonday2022-circuitpython-python-copy-copy/).

**Melissa**

This past week, I've spent most of my time working on refactoring [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org) in order to accommodate additional workflows. Part of it was re-familiarizing myself with the existing code and then coming up with a plan about how it should work and the steps I needed to get there. Once that was figured out, the refactoring itself was relatively quick. While the interface is still almost exactly the same at this point, the underlying code structure is now quite a bit better and more loosely coupled.

**Tim**

This week I continued working on the Octopus game guide and adding comments to the code for it. I believe the game is now set save for some smaller details like potentially highscore saving. I've also still been working on the Hack Tablet build of CircuitPython that is adding dot clock display support for displayio. The giveaway for these tablets was officially announced this week and entry form is available now for those that wish to enter for a chance to receive one. 

**Scott**

This week I've been improving the web workflow. I've just about finished adding dynamic reconfig and changing the port. I improved the responsiveness of the workflow so that it responds as other code is running. I've tweaked the C3's serial transmit code to improve reliability. Currently, I'm reworking the status title bar code so that it is only transmitted as needed and therefore, speed everything up.

**Liz**

This week I wrapped up the [IoT Pet Food Scale](https://learn.adafruit.com/iot-food-scale-with-azure-and-circuitpython) using CircuitPython with Microsoft Azure. I also made a [1-minute video](https://youtube.com/shorts/w9GubS0aSl8) about the project featuring one of the benefactors of the project: my cat Winnie.

I also worked on documenting the new 9-DoF sensor in the shop: the [LSM6DS3TR-C + LIS3MDL Stemma Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5543). I wrote up a [standalone guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-lsm6ds3tr-c-lis3mdl-precision-9-dof-imu) for it, added it to the [ST 9-DoF Combo Breakouts guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/st-9-dof-combo) and went through the [How to Fuse Motion Sensor Data into AHRS Orientation guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-fuse-motion-sensor-data-into-ahrs-orientation-euler-quaternions) to make sure magnetometer calibration was working as expected.
