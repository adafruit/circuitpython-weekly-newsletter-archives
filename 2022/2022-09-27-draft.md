Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! This week, tools have improved for making micirocontroller projects: a new MicroPython editor, updating the third-party online CircuitPython IDE and a nifty free Python script from Adafruit to make pretty script labels in Eagle CAD. Loving the use of RaspberryPi Pico to interface with old keyboards and some new Python-capable boards (and so many projects this week). Enjoy.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Mainline Python 3.14 Predicted to be Faster than C++ (Really??)

[![Python 3.14 Will be Faster than C++](../assets/20220927/20220927fast.jpg)](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-3-14-will-be-faster-than-c-a97edd01d65d)

In about a month, there will be a new yearly release of Python: version 3.11. The main feature for this version is a significant increase in speed. People are testing the new version and their results are stunning. Extrapolating keeping at this pace, Python 3.14 will be faster than C++. To be exact, the loop time will be -0.232 seconds, so it will be done just before you want to do the calculation - [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-3-14-will-be-faster-than-c-a97edd01d65d).

## Adafruit Pinguin - use any Font in EagleCAD

[![Adafruit Pinguin](../assets/20220927/20220927pinguin.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pinguin-for-eagle-cad?view=all)

Autodesk’s EAGLE — the PCB design software favored around Adafruit — has a problem: the circuit boards it produces, while perfectly functional, are ugly, with vintage plotter-like text and no font support. Pinguin is a Python script that substitutes TrueType fonts for EAGLE’s ugly plotter-stroke text. Open Source software - [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pinguin-for-eagle-cad?view=all).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were two new boards added!

- [Unexpected Maker TinyPICO](https://circuitpython.org/board/unexpectedmaker_tinypico/)
- [Unexpected Maker TinyPICO NANO](https://circuitpython.org/board/unexpectedmaker_tinypico_nano/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220927/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Kattni, Jeff, and I went over the issue list and PR list to triage what we really want to add or fix for CircuitPython 8.0.0. We reduced the number of issues, and assigned some to specific folks.

I am working on fixing some status bar glitches. This week I shepherded some PR's through from outside contributors that add new features we are very pleased to have.

Last week I added individual pin control during deep sleep on Espressif boards. I now need to investigate why the deep sleep power consumption is not as low on some boards as we might expect, and whether that can be fixed.

**Kattni**

This week I am working on a few things. I've been testing the MCP9600 on various microcontrollers, along with Carter who tested on Raspberry Pi, to be able to add more details to the guide on frequency settings. Found another place lacking documentation, and will get that updated as well. I started the guide for the LTR-329 and LTR-303 light sensor breakout boards, recently added to the shop. And finally, I'm working on the STEMMA QT revision guide update for the Quad Alphanumeric 14-segment backpack.

This past week, I've continued working on the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/). Now that web workflow is complete, I've been working to fix up Bluetooth and have been adding a USB workflow. At this point, I have the connection and serial terminal parts of the USB workflow working nicely, but I'm waiting until USB is complete before pushing the changes live.

This week I added docstrings and typing information to the PIL script that generates flip clock animation sprites. It turned out some of the variables for size and color were not functioning properly when used from the command line, so I discovered a few issues causing that and fixed them. For testing I generated some much smaller flip tiles with only 5 animation frames instead of 10, which made the spritesheets small enough that they can be used on a PyPortal which has less RAM than the ESP32-S2 which can run with the larger spritesheets. I also added the option to have a horizontal line in the middle of your tiles if you want.

I've been hard at work on support for the wireless module in the Raspberry Pi Pico W. Today I got to the point where it works well enough to start sharing it with others to get feedback. Here's the pull request: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/6933 -- check out my segment on last week's Show & Tell on youtube for a rundown of what works so far!

This week I worked on two new product guides: [the 24LC32 I2C EEPROM Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-24lc32-i2c-eeprom-breakout-32kbit-4-kb) and [the TCA8418 Keypad Matrix and GPIO Expander](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tca8418-keypad-matrix-and-gpio-expander-breakout). Both breakouts are STEMMA QT compatible and have CircuitPython libraries. I adapted [one of the Arduino examples to CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_TCA8418/blob/main/examples/tca8418_3x4_noOLED.py) for the guide to use a 3x4 numpad, so check that out if you've been curious about keypad matrixes.
