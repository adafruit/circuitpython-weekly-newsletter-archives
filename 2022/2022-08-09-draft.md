Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! A busy week in many folks' lives this past week! CircuitPython gains web workflow on standard ESP32 microcontrollers. CircuitPython Day is very near, see all the events and plan your own. And check out all the happenings worldwide - projects galore.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Web Workflow Added for ESP32 Programming in CircuitPython

[![Web Workflow Added for ESP32](../assets/20220809/20220809web1.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/08/07/a-first-test-of-circuitpython-on-esp32-web-workflow/)

Of all the great microcontrollers on the market today, ESP32 (the original, no suffix) had been left out of CircuitPython due to not having native USB, allowing it to act like a flash drive for code. Scott and Dan just merged in Web (WiFi) Workflow for CircuitPython 8.0.0 alpha and ESP32 which means that it’s now incredibly easy to start working with chips like the ESP32 which have excellent WiFi networking but do not have USB mass-storage - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/08/07/a-first-test-of-circuitpython-on-esp32-web-workflow/).

## Extending CircuitPython: The Fibonacci Adventure

[![The Fibonacci Adventure in Extending CircuitPython](../assets/20220809/20220809fib.jpg)](https://github.com/latkinso42/fibonacci/blob/Main/FibonacciStoryFULL.md)

Before actually contributing to CircuitPython, Lee Atkinson thought to try a toy extension. A non-hardware related Fibonacci Generator for the RaspberryPi Pico. The process is excellent at learning the methodologies on how to add to CircuitPython - [GitHub](https://github.com/latkinso42/fibonacci/blob/Main/FibonacciStoryFULL.md).
  
## 1,000 CircuitPython Library Bundle Releases

[![1,000 CircuitPython Library Bundle Releases](../assets/20220809/20220809thousand.jpg)](url)

Woohoo! we were just going to download the library bundle for a project and noticed....we have reached [1000 releases](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle)! We do a library bundle release nightly on every detected change - e.g. new version - of a submodule-d CircuitPython library. Psst! Did you know we have reached [300 official adafruit-written CircuitPython libraries](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/08/01/milestone-300-adafruit-provided-open-source-circuitpython-libraries-available-circuitpython-opensource-adafruit/)? 

Anyways, the bundle is great if you want to make sure you have all the latest libraries, it's also used by tools like [BundleFly](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/05/03/what-is-bundlefly/) and [PyLeap](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/04/pyleap-is-officially-available-in-the-app-store/) to get all the dependancies you need to make your project go.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added, but several are being workerd on.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220809/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm continuing to work on the plain ESP32 port. I got the port working on ESP32 boards with no PSRAM, and am now incorporating changes Scott made to determine flash and PSRAM pin assignments at run-time.

Once I finish on the ESP32, I will go back to addressing issues we want to fix for the 8.0.0 release.

**Jeff**

I've gotten quite far with the new camera module for the Espressif port. It works on boards with ESP32, ESP32-S2, and ESP32-S3 microcontrollers. However, some more features need to be added before it's at parity with the previous code.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Adafruit PCF8574 I2C Expander](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pcf8574) guide. It has everything you need to get started with this breakout, including examples in CircuitPython and Arduino. If you picked up one of these expanders, check out the guide!

I also put together the video content schedule for CircuitPython Day! Keep an eye out for that on the Adafruit blog.

**Melissa**

This past week I was out sick for a couple of days, but for the days I was able to work, I was able to finish refactoring the code structure of the [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org) website. After that was made live, I started refactoring the UI enough to start adding Web Workflow functionality.

**Tim**

I tested a fix for Ethernet connections with the Wiznet5k library. I investigated a difference around the tuple constructor having different behavior in CPython and CircuitPython / Micropython. I continued work on the Octopus guide, and made some final cleanups to a few of the sprite assets. I did the drawing for the initial selections for the Hack Tablet giveaway this week. The remaining winners will be selected 8/26.

**Scott**

This week I added two more ESP32 boards to CircuitPython and fixed some issues with them. I enabled the web workflow on the Feather ESP32 v2 as well. After that, I've been refining the title bar to add info about the running Python code, exceptions and the BLE workflow state. It adds a bit of code to the smallest builds so my next task is to figure out how to make it all fit.

**Liz**

This past week I worked on the (CircuitPython MIDI to CV Skull project)[https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-midi-to-cv-skull]. It's a fun little project that helps to integrate MIDI into your Eurorack or CV controlled synth setup. Big shout out to (Thea)[https://thea.codes/] and her (CircuitPython Winterbloom Eurorack modules)[https://winterbloom.com/about]. Her work is a huge inspiration for a lot of the music tech CircuitPython projects I've worked on.

Next up I'll be working on some new product documentation and a fun collab with the Ruiz brothers.
