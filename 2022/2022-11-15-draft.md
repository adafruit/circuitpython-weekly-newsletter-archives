Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Change is in the air. Ardiono embracing MicroPython in a bigger way kicks off this week's news. We also feature our first In the News from Mastodon as users migrate from Twitter. Some of Adafruit's content will be on pause, so features you might look for may be on hiatus until the new year. - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Arduino to support use of MicroPython and Introduces Arduino Lab for MicroPython

[![Arduino to support use of MicroPython](../assets/20221115/20221115arduino.jpg)](https://blog.arduino.cc/2022/11/10/micropython-officially-becomes-part-of-the-arduino-ecosystem/)

Arduino has partnered with Damien George to use MicroPython on a number of Arduino products. To accompany MicroPython, the new alpha Arduino Lab for MicroPython is available as an alpha release. It is a rebranded fork of work done by Murilo Polese on an IDE which has a similar look to the current Arduino IDE - [Arduino Blog](https://blog.arduino.cc/2022/11/10/micropython-officially-becomes-part-of-the-arduino-ecosystem/) and [Arduino Labs](https://labs.arduino.cc/en).

## PyScript Updates: Bytecode Alliance, Pyodide, and MicroPython

[![PyScript](../assets/20221115/20221115pyscript.jpg)](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/pyscript-updates-bytecode-alliance-pyodide-and-micropython)

Earlier this year, [Anaconda unveiled PyScript](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/2022/05/03/python-on-microcontrollers-newsletter-micropython-turns-9-pyconus-2022-and-more-python-circuitpython-micropython-thepsf/) to enable users to create Python applications in the browser. In order for PyScript to succeed, Anaconda must make strategic investments in both the project itself and its core technology dependencies, such as WebAssembly (Wasm) and the fantastic Pyodide open-source project (PyScript’s primary runtime). To that end, PyScript has been improving its technical foundations over the past few months - [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/pyscript-updates-bytecode-alliance-pyodide-and-micropython).

> We are showcasing a technical preview of a new runtime for PyScript based on MicroPython. MicroPython is excellent at running in constrained environments without an operating system and with limited resources. When you apply MicroPython to Wasm in its default configuration, something new and exciting emerges: With a total size of 303KB, this new runtime loads instantly and starts executing MicroPython logic in less than 100ms.<br>&nbsp;<br>While very early in the development process, this runtime will be excellent for creative, educational, and visualization use cases. The MicroPython runtime enables PyScript in many development scenarios where the current runtime loading performance is problematic. Since PyScript supports multiple runtimes via configuration, developers can choose the runtime that best fits the particular problem.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I was out for about a week, so my report here is brief.

The LC709203F battery gauge we use on many Feather Espressif boards does not work well on the ESP32-S3. I am attempting some workarounds in the battery gauge library, and having users test the changes.

I am also working on pin sleep issues on the RP2040. If the pin changes state prematurely, before the sleep actually happens, it can prevent wakeup during sleep.

**Kattni**

This past week I worked on the Adafruit PiCowbell Proto guide. This nifty little Raspberry Pi Pico add-on board adds a STEMMA QT connector, a reset button, and protospace to your Pico. There are four ways to assemble it, each detailed in the guide. There are also code examples of how to check to see if your I2C breakout is attached properly through the STEMMA QT connector. Finally, there are pinouts details and downloads resources. It has everything you need to get started with your PiCowbell Proto! If you picked up one of these excellent boards, keep an eye out for this new guide!

**Melissa**

This past week I've been working on catching up on GitHub issues. One of the larger projects that I had put on hold was converting the Raspberry Pi Installer scripts to python. Part of the reason for putting that on hold was because there were some intermittently odd bugs in the Adafruit_Python_Shell library that I wanted to avoid putting into play.

After spending a bit of time really diving in, I was able to make some tests that consistently reproduced the issues and I was able to figure out the fixes to resolve the issue.

**Tim**

This week I got a new desktop computer and it took some time to get everything set up for development, I've got everything needed for core builds, docs builds, library PRs, and pre-commit working in the new environment. I tested a PR for some social media API requests, and added svg icon types to the tool that generates screenshots of projects and libraries.

**Jeff**

I wrote a new library called NeoPxl8 and added it to the bundle. This library supports 8 simultaneous NeoPixel strands on 8 adjacent GPIO pins on the RP2040 microcontroller. This is inspired by some of the ideas of the Adafruit's NeoPxl8 library for Arduino, but is an independent implementation that only works on RP2040.

It's high performance because it not only writes the data to all 8 strands at the same time, it does it in the background so your CircuitPython code can start calculating the next frame of its animation right away. And yes, it works with the LED Animation Library, so that all your previous knowledge about creating great light shows transfers directly to NeoPxl8.

This library works with any board that has an RP2040 and 8 sequentially adjacent GPxx pins, so you can use it with a Raspberry Pi Pico, Pico W, or Adafruit Feather RP2040, Adafruit KB2040, and others. But the library will really hit its stride with the forthcoming "Scorpio" board designed just for controlling lots of NeoPixels.

**Liz**

This week I worked on updating the [Si5351 clock generator guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-si5351-clock-generator-breakout) to include the new STEMMA QT version of the board. I also worked on a guide for the new IR LED Emitter board. Both guides have pages for pinouts, CircuitPython, Arduino and resource files. The [Pico W HTTP Server with CircuitPython guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/pico-w-http-server-with-circuitpython) that I mentioned last week also went live.

I was really excited and humbled that on [11/9's Show and Tell](https://youtu.be/WOQj1rdlOus) two guests came by with versions of projects that I've written guides on. I am continually thankful for the opportunity to do this work full-time and that was definitely a highlight to see folks learning and having fun with the guides I've written.
