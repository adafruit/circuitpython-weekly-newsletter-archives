Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! This week there are more projects than usual, so you may wish to browse them to look for items of interest.

We're online! Go to [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## The CircuitPython in 2022 Survey

[![CircuitPython in 2022](../assets/20220111/20220111cp2022.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/01/circuitpython-in-2022-circuitpython2022-circuitpython/)

As 2022 starts, Scott Shawcroft, lead CircuitPython developer, requests the Python on Hardware community take time to share their goals for CircuitPython in 2022. 

Just like past years (full summary [2019](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/28/circuitpython-in-2019/), [2020](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/02/03/circuitpython2020-recap/), and [2021](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/02/16/circuitpython2021-round-up/)), Adafruit would like everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the Internet. 

Here are a few ways to post:

* a video on YouTube
* a post on the CircuitPython forum
* a blog post on your site
* a series of Tweets
* a Gist on GitHub

Please consider sharing your thoughts. When you post, please add #CircuitPython2022 and email circuitpython2022@adafruit.com to let the teams know about your post so they can blog it up - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/01/circuitpython-in-2022-circuitpython2022-circuitpython/).

## TIOBE Declares Python Programming Language of the Year 2021

[![Python Programming Language of the Year](../assets/20220111/20220111tiobe.jpg)](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)

Python has won the prestigious TIOBE Programming Language of the Year award for 2021. This is the second time in a row. The award is given to the programming language that has gained the highest increase in ratings in one year. C# was on its way to get the title for the first time in history, but Python surpassed C# in the last month.

Python started at position #3 of the TIOBE index at the beginning of 2021 and left both Java and C behind to become the number one of the TIOBE index. But Python's popularity didn't stop there. It is currently more than 1 percent ahead of the rest. Java's all time record of 26.49% ratings in 2001 is still far away, but Python has it all to become the de facto standard programming language for many domains - [TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).

## Using Both Cores of a Raspberry Pi Pico in MicroPython

[![Using Both Cores of a Raspberry Pi Pico in MicroPython](../assets/20220111/20220111cores.gif)](https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/2022/01/08/pico-dual-core-midi-visualisations/)

diyelectromusic has been doing musical/MIDI visualization projects with Raspberry Pi Pico. Dual use of an LED matrix and a 4x7-segment display was a bit slow. So they looked to use the unused core on the Pico to provide extra processing power. 

> One core is listening to the MIDI and updating the LED matrix using the WS2812 protocol; the other is keeping the 8-segment LED scanning (over SPI) showing the last MIDI command/note received.

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220111/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **343**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Last week I [added some features to countio](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/5803), allowing counting of both rising and falling edges, and also added pullup/pulldown support. This week I wrote a simple example demonstrating using asyncio to control and vary a NeoPixel animation. Now I am working on some further bugs we should fix for the next release of CircuitPython.

**Jeff**

I've been pulled into the floppy vortex of winter 2021/2022. With some work-in-progress code, I can grab raw flux timings in CircuitPython, then take them to a desktop computer and decode MFM data with a second Python program. The ultimate goal is to allow read access to old DOS floppies directly in CircuitPython with `mount("/floppy", floppy)`

**Melissa**

This past week was short for me, but I started splitting the Blinka Displayio shared functions into a Display Core module. The transition is started, but due to the relatively small number of people that are actually using the system and the availability of much better graphics systems, it makes sense to not put any more work into the library, so I am leaving it to the community or whomever wants to use it to advance it more. The library can be found at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_Displayio.

I also started on a second project to generate a LittleFS file system using pure JavaScript. There were other projects that had made a wrapper around the c code, but no actual ports, so this will be the first port, though really only a partial one since only a subset of the features will be required. This will replace the NVM Generator that I had made last year since it will work on both the ESP32 and the ESP8266.

**Scott**

I'm just starting up after taking another long weekend for the holidays. My main goal this week is to wrap up the Raspberry Pi work for the time being and spend some time on the ESP32-S3. I've got a pull request out that adds Pi Zero support and hopefully fixes the SD card support along with it. The last thing I want to do is merge in Piunora support because I've already started. I should be able to get all of those changes out this week.

On New Year's Day I also kicked off #CircuitPython2022. I'm excited to see where folks would like CircuitPython to go. I'm going to do a retrospective on #CircuitPython2021 for my first stream of the year and then follow up with #CircuitPython2022 the following stream. So, please let us know when you post something by emailing circuitpython2022@adafruit.com. Thanks!
