Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! The long awaited CircuitPython support for the Raspberry Pi Pico W is arriving in the latest beta releases. Projects are already taking advantage and expect a new beta soon with even more capability. Linux hits version 6 with more Arm support. A whole host of projects that will astound you this issue also. Please enjoy the newsletter - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## CircuitPython Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W Hits Version 8-beta.1

[![CircuitPython Support for Raspberry Pi Pico W](../assets/20221011/20221011picow.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico_w/)

Work on the CircuitPython support for Raspberry Pi Pico W has reached the point where it has been released on circuitpython.org. While not feature complete in CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.1, it is useable for several types of WiFi use. It is currently being actively worked on by Adafruit - [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico_w/).

Liz posts about trying out WiFi on Pico W - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BlitzCityDIY/status/1578188289097764865).

## Linux 6.0 Arrives Supporting Newer Cchips, Core Fixes, and More

[![Linux 6.0 arrives](../assets/20221011/20221011linux.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/04/linux-6-0-arrives-supporting-newer-chips-core-fixes-and-more-linux-arstechnica/)

A stable version of Linux 6.0 is out, with 15,000 non-merge commits and a notable version number for the kernel. And while major Linux releases only happen when the prior number’s dot numbers start looking too big—”there is literally no other reason“ — there are a lot of notable things rolled into this release. 

Lenovo’s ThinkPad X13s, based on an ARM-powered Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, get some early support in 6.0. ARM support is something Linux founder Linus Torvalds is eager to see and believes that more people using Linux on ARM devices leads to more bug reports, more patches, and more enthusiasm - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/04/linux-6-0-arrives-supporting-newer-chips-core-fixes-and-more-linux-arstechnica/) and [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/linux-6-0-arrives-with-support-for-newer-chips-core-fixes-and-oddities/).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20221011/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.1 on October 1. Given the speed with which Jeff is improving the Pico W WiFi implementation, I expect to do another beta release soon.

I improved dotenv parsing, to make it match the CPython version more closely. I also added a test, which Jeff improved to run automatically.

The Module Support Matrix in the ReadTheDocs documentation for CircuitPython lists which native modules are available on which boards. It was missing a few modules, and I added those: `_asyncio`, `array`, `builtins`, `collections`, `io`, `select`, and `sys`, all of which link to the appropriate documentation.

I am now investigating some Espressif WiFi problems, aided by a lot of testing from the community.

**Kattni**

This week I continued on the LTR-329 and LTR-303 guide. There was a fix to both the Arduino and CircuitPython libraries that came in with good timing, as I had not yet started those sections of the guide. 

I also tested issue #6676 on the CircuitPython core. This was an issue someone experienced regarding running `TimeAlarm` and `PinAlarm` together. Turns out the issue was never with running them together, but with a particular way `PinAlarm` expects to be set up. I closed that issue as resolved and created a new issue regarding the actual problem.

**Melissa**

This past week I decided to take a break from working on the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/) and turn my attention back to Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye and Picamera2 now that a newer version of Raspberry Pi OS has come out with it included. My goal was to update the [Running TensorFlow Lite Object Recognition on the Raspberry Pi 4](https://learn.adafruit.com/running-tensorflow-lite-on-the-raspberry-pi-4) guide, but it ended up being quite a rabbit hole. I was able to mostly get the code updated to work in the desktop environment, but with lots of testing, it doesn't appear to currently run on Raspberry Pi OS lite. I will keep working on a few other things before getting back to the Code editor.

This past week I worked on a [CircuitPython Controller for Trombone Champ](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-trombone-champ-controller). Trombone Champ is a fun rhythm game similar to Guitar Hero but featuring a trombone. A lot of folks have been making custom controllers, so we thought it'd be fun to make a CircuitPython one using a NeoSlider and an arcade button with a QT Py RP2040. 

I also worked on adapting the [Easy No-Soldering Bluetooth Controlled Room Lights](https://learn.adafruit.com/easy-no-solder-bluetooth-controlled-room-lights/overview) project for the [CLUE and imported the project into PyLeap](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyleap-ble-controlled-neopixels-with-clue) and wrote up a guide for it. The project uses the Bluefruit Connect app to control a strip of NeoPixels by using the controller and color wheel modules to change the color or animation. For the CLUE, I added that the animation name or RGB color code is displayed on the screen.
