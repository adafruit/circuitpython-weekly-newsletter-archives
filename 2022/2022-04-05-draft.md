Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! The parts shortage has now affected Raspberry Pi 4 and CM4 availability. We find out why. Also a new version of CircuitPython is out and a new beta also! More news and projects await so enjoy this week's issue.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Raspberry Pi Founder Discusses Shortages

[![title](../assets/20220405/20220405rpi.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/production-and-supply-chain-update/)

Eben Upton released an update discussing the supply issues for Raspberry Pi single board computers (SBC) which include the Raspberry Pi 4 and the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/production-and-supply-chain-update/).

"Over the last six months we’ve been working hard to get more Raspberry Pi products built and shipped to customers. Despite a variety of supply-chain challenges, we’ve consistently been able to build around half a million of our single-board computers and Compute Module products each month."<br> <br>
"As we’ve said before, the current situation is as much a demand shock as a supply shock: demand for Raspberry Pi products increased sharply from the start of 2021 onwards, and supply constraints have prevented us from flexing up to meet this demand, with the result that we now have significant order backlogs for almost all products. Many Approved Resellers have implemented single-unit limits to combat this, with Adafruit and others going further and enforcing two-factor authentication – we’re encouraging other Approved Resellers to consider this route. So, what should you do if you need to buy a Raspberry Pi in 2022?Always buy from an Approved Reseller."

## Two New CircuitPython Releases

[![Two New CircuitPython Releases](../assets/20220405/20220405cp7.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/31/circuitpython-7-2-4-released/)

Two new versions of CircuitPython came out last week - [CircuitPython 7.2.4](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/31/circuitpython-7-2-4-released/) and [CircuitPython 7.3.0-beta.0](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/31/circuitpython-7-3-0-beta-0-released/).

Notable changes to 7.3.0 since 7.2.4:
* Experimental mDNS support.
* USB to Serial/JTAG support for REPL on appropriate boards.
* Initial experimental USB host support.
* Merge MicroPython 1.18 changes.

Notable fixes to 7.2.4 since 7.2.3:
* Enable I2C power by default on Feather ESP32-S2.
* Fix `supervisor.reload()`.

## Adafruit IO is now storing over 1 billion data records

[![Adafruit IO is now storing over 1 billion data records](../assets/20220405/20220405aio.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/01/adafruit-io-is-now-storing-over-1-billion-data-records/)

Adafruit IO has reached a milestone in that it now stores over 1 billion data records.

The interesting part about this is that due to how free accounts work, most of that data rolls over after 30 days and is deleted.

> TOTAL DATA RECORDS 1 Billion (1003060059)

Adafruit continues to grow the infrastructure behind IO to support their free and paid users. They’re adding new features and are looking forward to new users discovering the product.

In the last month, Adafruit has added new dashboard blocks, updated Actions, had major updates to Wippersnapper (with more on the way) and they have more updates planned - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/01/adafruit-io-is-now-storing-over-1-billion-data-records/).

And read more on new features to IO Actions - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/31/adafruit-io-new-actions-features/).

## Linux 5.17 Released

[![Linux 5.17 Released](../assets/20220405/20220405linux.jpg)](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wj4fFjx2pgbGNBM4wJs3=eReZ05EQyprzgT2Jv8qJ2vJg@mail.gmail.com/)

Linux 5.17 was released late last month. Most of it is in drivers (net, usb, drm), with some core networking, and some tooling updates. Linux 5.17 progress was slowed by a week because the team had to deal with patches for another variation on the Spectre attacks, which added to the workload - [Kernel.org](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wj4fFjx2pgbGNBM4wJs3=eReZ05EQyprzgT2Jv8qJ2vJg@mail.gmail.com/).

## Compose with Markdown in Google Docs on web

[![Compose with Markdown in Google Docs](../assets/20220405/20220405md.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/31/compose-with-markdown-in-google-docs-on-web-google/)

In Google Docs, you can now select “Automatically detect Markdown” from Tools > Preferences to enable auto correcting for Markdown syntax, a lightweight markup language for applying formatting using plain text  - [Google](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/03/compose-with-markdown-in-google-docs-on.html) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/31/compose-with-markdown-in-google-docs-on-web-google/).

Currently, Google Docs supports some Markdown syntax, such as:

 \* or – followed by a space autocorrects to bullet points

Various ways to start a numbered list similar to Markdown

\[\] followed by a space autocorrects to checkboxes

The expanded support will now support autocorrection for:

* Headings
* Italic and bold
* Bold + italic
* Strikethrough
* Links

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.2.4 to fix a small number of bugs, and also released CircuitPython 7.3.0-beta.0, the first 7.3.x release. 7.3.0-beta.0 includes about 75 pull requests merged since 7.2.x was branched from the main line branch.

I have been fixing bugs and doing reviews. There are still a few more bugs to fix for 7.2.x, and larger number for 7.3.0.

MicroPython recently fixed a number of `asyncio` issues; they will need to be incorporated into our version of the library and the CircuitPython core.

**Jeff**

This past week I actually worked on some CircuitPython bugs! There was an interesting bug on boards with samd51 microcontrollers where, every 3 days, the time could rarely and briefly go backwards by 3 days. There's a fix for it, which we hope to merge soon.

**Kattni**

This week I proofed Liz's first STEMMA QT revision guide completed on her own. She did a wonderful job! 

I had a huge amount of miscellaneous piling up, so I spent a day going through all of that to get it out of the way. They were mostly small things, but they had been collecting for a while.

Finally, I added a MicroPython Setup page to the Feather ESP32 V2 guide. It shows how to blink the LED from the REPL, and how to use Thonny to load a simple WiFi connection demo.

**Melissa**

This past week I finished up two new learn guides. The first one is the [Adafruit 1.47" Round Rectangle TFT Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-47-round-rectangle-tft-display) learn guide and the other one is the [Adafruit 1.9" Color IPS TFT Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-9-color-ips-tft-display).

I also worked on Blinka a bit and updated the `libgpiod_pin` module to work with both older and newer versions of `libgpiod`. The reason this was an issue is because Blinka was still using the older version and they had different APIs. Rather than break it for users by just updating, it made more sense to support both.

**Tim**

This week I made some colorful and fun examples using the `RotatedPolygon` helper class that was created last week. I will be digging further into the core `vectorio` module to try to enable the capability to use the `hidden` property for hiding and showing shapes the same way that `displayio` TileGrids and Groups work. I also created a `PagedLayout` class for the `DisplayIO_Layout` library that provides a very easy to use interface for building multi-page applications and being able to change which page is showing at any given time, ultimately I hope to expand the `PagedLayout` into a `TabLayout` that uses button tabs to allow the user to change between the pages. I hope to use these new widgets to create a new version of the PyPortal Interface learn guide example project that is updated to use asyncio and some of the other newer features in CircuitPython.

**Liz**

Last week I published the [Raspberry Pi Video Synth guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-video-synth-with-blinka-and-processing). I also made a [one-minute video about the project](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CbvDPN3Aw6B/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).

Big thanks to Kattni for proofing my first solo STEMMA QT revision guide. I'll be working on my first solo new product guide this week for the TSC2007 STEMMA board. I've also started working on a new project with a QT Py ESP32-S2. I'm using it to control a Pure Data script over a socket. Its final form will be a funky, wireless synth controller.
