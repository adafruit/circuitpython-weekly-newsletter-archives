## Floppy Interfacing Hack Chat with Adafruit and Hackaday.io

[![Floppy Interfacing Hack Chat with Adafruit](../assets/20220201/20220201chat.jpg)](https://hackaday.io/event/183426-floppy-interfacing-hack-chat-with-adafruit)

Adafruit's Limor "Ladyada" Fried, Jeff Epler, and Phillip Torrone will host the Hack Chat on Wednesday, February 2 at noon Pacific. Time zones got you down? Try the [handy time zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20220202T12&p0=224&msg=Floppy+Interfacing+Hack+Chat&font=cursive).

When a tiny fleck of plastic-covered silicon can provide enough capacity to store a fair percentage of humanity's collected knowledge, it may seem like a waste of time to be fooling around with archaic storage technology like floppy disks. With several orders of magnitude less storage capacity than something like even the cheapest SD card or thumb drive, and access speeds that clock in somewhere between cold molasses and horse and buggy, floppy drives really don't seem like they have any place on the modern hacker's bench.

Or do they? Learning the ins and out of interfacing floppy drives with modern microcontrollers is at least an exercise in hardware hacking that can pay dividends in other projects. A floppy drive is, after all, a pretty complex little device, filled with electromechanical goodies that need to be controlled in a microcontroller environment. And teasing data from a stream of magnetic flux changes ends up needing some neat hacks that might just serve you well down the line.

So don't dismiss the humble floppy drive as a source for hacking possibilities. The folks at Adafruit sure haven't, as they've been working diligently to get [native floppy disk support built right into CircuitPython](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/11/native-floppy-disk-support-coming-soon-to-circuitpython/). To walk us through how they got where they are now, Ladyada, Jeff, and PT will drop by the Hack Chat. Be sure to come with your burning questions on flux transitions, MFM decoding, interface timing issues, and other arcana of spinning rust drives.

[![Golioth](../assets/20220201/20220201golioth.jpg)](https://blog.golioth.io/click-save-to-stream-iot-device-data-to-the-cloud/)

What if you could open a text document on a device, write code, click save, and everything magically starts working? This is the promise of high level programming languages like CircuitPython. Golioth Labs now has an SDK to utilize the language’s fast prototyping capabilities. In addition to Golioth’s cloud functions, it’s super easy to pass data from a networked device up to the Golioth cloud.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

This week I continued working on presenting multiple filesystems over USB Mass Storage in CircuitPython. I haven't yet found a way to do this dynamically that works well on Windows or macOS. If we can't figure out a way, we'll provide an API to reset the USB connection, and/or allow you to request in advance that specific filesystems be mounted when **code.py** starts.

I debugged an ESP32-S2 deep sleep problem that turned out to be a hardware issue. I'm continuing to debug other peripheral issues that have been reported recently.

**Jeff**

Again, my work has been behind the scenes on floppy drive stuff. We're learning more about the tools for converting among various floppy drive archival formats, and also I started working on using the PIO peripheral in the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller, which enables more accurate reading & writing of floppy disks.

One big milestone was that with our work in progress floppy code, we were able to preserve a classic Commodore 64 game, Archon, including emulating the original copy protection system on the floppy disk, and make the result directly playable by anyone on the archive.org website.  Check out last week's [Show & Tell](https://youtu.be/oWC4pC-3Bz0) program on YouTube if you want to hear more about that.

This week I've been working on finishing up the TFT Feather guide. I took a detour to get Arduino support added to the various RP2040 board guides. 

Once that's done, I'll be looking at creating some new groups on the Adafruit Learn System. Groups are a set of related guides that you can find in one place. I think a Getting Started with CircuitPython group will be a great place to start. Keep an eye out for that and more coming soon!

This past week I continued working on porting LittleFS over to JavaScript. However, I decided to take a different approach and found a package called LittleFS-JS that uses Emscripten to encapsulate the C library in a JavaScript wrapper. I was able to get this to mostly function, but have been running into a problem that it was built around a very early version of LittleFS and the resulting file is not readable by the latest version. I'm currently working on trying to get the latest version to compile, but even though it compiles, none of the functions are available.

This last week I've been focused on adding Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support to the ESP32-S3. I've made good progress and can now scan for advertisements from other devices. I'm working on getting that merged as a starting point.

At the same time, I'm working to add advertising support so that the device can advertise to others. This segues nicely into basic connection functionality which will come after that. I've been thinking of a number of projects I'd like to do so I'm motivated to get things going.
