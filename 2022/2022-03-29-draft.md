Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Python on microcontrollers continues to be a popular option, driving the introduction of hardware and innovating in software features and drivers for add-on hardware.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## New Python Twitter Communities

[![MicroPython Twitter Community](../assets/20220329/20220329mtc.jpg)](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1506567111837159424)

Twitter launched Twitter Communities to give people a dedicated place to connect, share, and get closer to the discussions they care about most. Communities are started and managed by people on Twitter — admins and moderators who enforce Community rules and keep conversations informative, relevant, and fun. People who accept invites to join a Community become members. Tweets in Communities can be seen by anyone on Twitter, but only others within the Community itself can engage and participate in the discussion. 

[![CircuitPython Twitter Community](../assets/20220329/20220329ctc.jpg)](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1506567111837159424)

Two communities related to Python on Hardware now exist: the [Twitter MicroPython Community](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1506567111837159424) and the [CircuitPython Twitter Community](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1506684289622106117).

## A New Major Thonny Update is in Beta

[![Thonny Editor](../assets/20220329/20220329thonny.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/25/thonny-python-editor-gets-4-0-0-beta-release-python-micropython/)

The Thonny Python editor had received a version 4.0.0 beta 1 release. They are looking for help in reporting bugs and bug fixes.

There are many changes since 3.3.13. Here are some notable ones:

* Upgrade bundled Python to 3.10
* Mac bundle now comes with the unversal2 build of Python
* Drop support for Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7
* Use [pipkin](https://pypi.org/project/pipkin/) for managing packages on MicroPython and CircuitPython devices. This enables proper listing of packages together with version info and proper uninstallation.
* Automatically interrupt current process when connecting to bare-metal MicroPython or CircuitPython device.
* Add generic “MicroPython (RP2040)” back-end in addition to the more specific “MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)”

## Dmitry Cherepanov’s Retro Computer Museum in Mariupol, Ukraine, Has Been Destroyed

[![Retro computer museum](../assets/20220329/20220329ukraine.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/28/dmitry-cherepanovs-retro-computer-museum-in-mariupol-ukraine-has-been-destroyed/)

According to Dmitry Cherepanov, collector and owner of the Club 8-bit, the the museum consisted of more than half a thousand computers, consoles and other devices – even arcade games recently - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/28/dmitry-cherepanovs-retro-computer-museum-in-mariupol-ukraine-has-been-destroyed/) and [Keyboard Builder's Digest](https://kbd.news/Mariupol-computer-museum-destroyed-1327.html).

> “Well, that’s all, the computer museum of Mariupol is no more. All that remains of my collection that I have been collecting for 15 years is just fragments of memories on the Facebook page, the website and the radio station of the museum. I will try to continue to support the RetroBit website and radio, but life will now have completely different priorities. There is neither my museum nor my home and it hurts, but I will definitely survive it and find a new home! – [it8bit.club](https://it8bit.club/) and [YouTube](https://kbd.news/Mariupol-computer-museum-destroyed-1327.html).”

### Adafruit Information to Russians Seeking Ukraine Information

[![Arnols Speaks](../assets/20220329/20220329arnold.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/russia)

Adafruit has set up their website such that any traffic coming from Russia sees the page https://www.adafruit.com/russia. This page has resources to help everyday Russian prople know more about the war (censored by the Russian government), see and read the message from Arnold Schwarzenegger about Ukraine, use of Tor and Kiwix to download resources such as Wikipedia and more. Hopefully this all will keep ordinary Russians informed as to what their government is doing in Ukraine - [Webpage](https://www.adafruit.com/russia).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added but some are being worked on.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I've been cleaning up the adafruit_requests library, and am now testing some async additions to it.

Jeff, Scott, and I reviewed the list of near-term bugs to fix in CircuitPython, in preparation for Scott's multi-week leave.

**Jeff**

While I've added good support for imaging non-protected Apple II floppies, I'd like to add support for copy-protected Apple II floppies to Adafruit_Floppy as well. To this end, I've started implementing the ".a2r" format used by Applesauce. This format has good open documentation, as well as some open source software that can use it. I'll continue to work on an open pull request to add support for this format to FluxEngine, and also make sure that it works with the proprietary Applesauce software for macs.

**Kattni**

This week, I worked with Liz (BlitzCityDIY) to walk her through creating new product guides. Her first two guides are live! We also worked on her learning how to do a breakout STEMMA QT revision guide update. She updated her first guide, and is working on updating her second guide on her own. Liz has been doing great!

In between working with Liz, I got through some of the miscellaneous on my list, and a few new things that popped up along the way. The ESP32-S2 CircuitPython Internet Test page has been updated to be standalone and use the Project Bundler, and removed the CircuitPython Internet Libraries page rendered obsolete by the update. I updated a few things on the Feather ESP32-S2 guide to reflect the new revision of the board. I updated the Adafruit IO template WiFi code to be more robust and not crash on disconnection.

As well, I submitted my first PR to MicroPython to expose pin 20 on the ESP32 so it works with the Feather ESP32 V2. It was merged!

This past week I started working on a couple of guides for displays. This included updating the Arduino Display libraries and adding board-specific examples so there is less fussing with initializers such as [this 1.47" ImageReader example](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ImageReader/tree/master/examples/BreakoutST7789-172x320). I'm actually updating the format of the guide a bit so that some past guides can be revised to use the same format. I'm hoping it will be even more helpful to users than the previous format was in the past.

This week I dove into the CircuitPython core module `vectorio` to add a new feature allowing the user code to set the color index within the palette to use for coloring the shapes. I reviewed and tested some more PRs including some typing PRs from a few newer contributors to the libraries. I also started building some Python level helper classes on top of `vectorio` objects. So far the ones available are a line with settable stroke size, an outlined rectangle with a border around it, and a rotatable polygon that allows you to specify arbitrary rotations in degrees and handles all of the math to find the new points to make up the polygon.

I worked with Kattni to get the VL53L4CD and MCP23017 new product guides live. She also showed me how to do the updated product guides and we updated the Analog Devices ADXL343 guide. 

I also worked on a project guide for a Raspberry Pi Video Synth. The hardware is controlled with Blinka and the animations are running with Processing. The Python and Processing scripts are communicating together with a socket. I think that that is one of the most useful aspects of the project and will hopefully be useful for folks who want to use CircuitPython on a Raspberry Pi to communicate with other programming languages.

This week I've been wrapping up pending code and taking on small tasks. My partner and I are about to have a baby so I'm not getting myself into anything too big.

I added mDNS support to ESP builds. I added support for the USB to Serial/JTAG on the C3 so it can be used for CircuitPython serial. I just made a PR to support the ESP32-S3 USB-OTG devkit from Espressif. I also cleaned up a bunch of board definitions prior to that so that we wouldn't keep duplicating unnecessary settings.

I'll keep picking up small tasks or continue brainstorming for the [web workflow](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/6174) until the baby arrives. After that, I'll be out six weeks.
