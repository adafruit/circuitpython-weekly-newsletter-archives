Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! More news in the Raspberry Pi field while CircuitPytghon and MicroPython continue to do heavy lifting in making microcontroller projects easier to implement.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## 500 Adafruit Projects Have Been Certified as Open Source by OSHWA

[![500 Adafruit Projects](../assets/20220215/20220215oshw.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/02/07/500-adafruit-projects-have-been-certified-as-open-source-by-oshwa/)

Adafruit is an Open Source Hardware and Software company. To that end, Adafruit has been working to submit many of their boards for certification by the Open Source Hardware Association. According to OSHWA:

> The certification program exists to make it easy for creators and users to identify hardware that follows the community definition of open source hardware maintained by OSHWA. Hardware projects that display the certification logo are licensed and documented in a way that makes it easy for users to use and build upon them.

On February 7th, Adafruit hit the milestone of 500 certified projects and was the first to reach this number. By registering their boards with OSHWA, Adafruit aims to ensure users that the products they sell are open-source, and easy to learn about.

Adafruit extends a special thank you to everyone who made this possible, but especially the wonderful folks over at OSHWA who set all this up and were incredibly helpful throughout this process. Additionally, they thank the community that keeps this all going and encourages them to publish, share, and more! - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/02/07/500-adafruit-projects-have-been-certified-as-open-source-by-oshwa/).

## Raspberry Pi Beta Tests Network Install of Raspberry Pi OS

[![Raspberry Pi Beta Test](../assets/20220215/20220215net.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/network-install-beta-test-your-help-required/)

Until recently, you’ve always needed to use another computer to run [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#using-raspberry-pi-imager), or to run something similar, to let you flash your operating system onto an SD card when you get a new Raspberry Pi. But how do you get the operating system onto an SD card if you don’t have another computer in the first place?

There is now a **beta version** of the Raspberry Pi bootloader that implements network installation, and we’d like your help to test it. The new [Network Install](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#installing-over-the-network-beta) feature can be used to start the Raspberry Pi Imager application directly on a Raspberry Pi 4, or a Raspberry Pi 400, by downloading it from the internet using an Ethernet cable. The Raspberry Pi Imager application, which runs in memory on a Raspberry Pi, can then be used to flash the operating system onto a blank SD Card or USB disk - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/network-install-beta-test-your-help-required/).

## Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit vs. 64-bit Benchmarks

[![Raspberry Pi OS Benchmarks](../assets/20220215/20220215test.jpg)](https://openbenchmarking.org/result/2202058-NE-RASPBERRY79&sgm=1)

Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit vs. 64-bit Benchmarks have been compiled. Most operations benefit from 64-bit software use. The best speedup is performing the Sysbench CPU test, a 1,380% speedup. Overall using the 64-bit operating system gave a 48% faster response overall - [OpenBenchmarking.org](https://openbenchmarking.org/result/2202058-NE-RASPBERRY79&sgm=1).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were no new boards added, but several are nearly ready.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **344**!

**New Libraries!**

Here's this week's new CircuitPython libraries:

 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_HTTPServer](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HTTPServer)

**Updated Libraries!**

This week's updated libraries are too many to list!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I am continuing to look at asyncio support for HTTP clients (and potentially servers). I have looked at several async HTTP client libraries. Most have quite similar API's. I am leaning toward writing a simple one that does not mimic one of these exactly, but is still very similar.

For another small project, mentioned last week, I wrote a [simple HTTP server library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HTTPServer) that runs on CircuitPython and also on CPython.

I released CircuitPython 7.2.0-alpha.2, which has nearly two months of changes.

**Jeff**

I continued work on floppy disks, but now I'm truly getting close to wrapping things up. I'll take a little breather before bringing the latest changes into CircuitPython. What I spent the last week working on was using the RP2040's PIO peripheral to accurately capture & generate the flux waveforms that define how data is stored on floppies. Using CircuitPython it was very easy to test & refine the portion of the software that runs on the PIO mini-CPUs inside the RP2040; much harder, by contrast, was making it all work within the Arduino environment.

**Kattni**

This week I updated the 0.56" LED backpack [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-led-backpack/overview) with the new STEMMA QT rev, as well as the MCP4725 [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/mcp4725-12-bit-dac-tutorial) for the same. I'm now working on the guide for the ADXL375, a new accelerometer we added to the shop recently. It needed a CircuitPython library which I wrote up and will use in the guide. Keep an eye out for that!

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20220215/20220215melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week, I finally worked the last of the bugs out of the LittleFS port. This was packaged up as part of the WipperSnapper Firmware Uploader, which will generate a LittleFS image with a secrets.json file on it and flash the image right onto either an ESP32 or ESP8266. Currently WipperSnapper isn't live for the ESP8266, so other than flashing everything onto it, you can't currently do anything with it, but soon many Feather Huzzah ESP8266 boards will be able to easily be flashed with and configured without needing to write a single line of code.

**Tim**

I have been working on going through all of the open library PRs to review and test them or ping authors as needed. A cool one from this week was a new motion sensing feature for the VC0706 camera device. I had not ever used cameras with CircuitPython before so it was neat to get it set up and learn how to snap photos from it. The motion sensing could be useful as a primitave security camera type setup, only saving photos when motion is sensed in order to maximize the available storage space. 

This week I also wrapped up the code for the PyPortal Winamp player project and have started writing the guide pages for it. Part of that process was generalizing a ScrollingLabel widget that I initially coded for this project and getting it prepared to share in the Display Text library. The new version was recently published with this new displayio [ScrollingLabel](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Display_Text/blob/main/adafruit_display_text/scrolling_label.py) widget. The Winamp player project will use it, but it can now also be used by anyone else for other projects as well.

**Scott**

This week I've been working to wrap up BLE GATT client support on the ESP32-S3. As I said last week, I've been somewhat stuck on this, so I'm going to wrap up my pending work and then dig into USB Host support in CircuitPython on the RP2040. [sekigon-gonnoc on GitHub](https://github.com/sekigon-gonnoc/Pico-PIO-USB) has figured out how to use PIO for USB Host which could make the RP2040 a neat USB bridge device. 

I've wanted to start learning USB host to add support to the broadcom port at some point too. This will be a chance to learn it in a simpler system.
