Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Exciting news with the first alpha release of CircuitPython 8 out and some very special artwork has been designed and unveiled here first!

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## CircuitPython 8.0.0 alpha 1 released!

[![CircuitPython 8.0.0 alpha 1](../assets/20220614/20220614cc.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/06/09/circuitpython-8-0-0-alpha-1-released/)

The CircuitPython team has released CircuitPython 8.0.0-alpha.1, an alpha version for 8.0.0. It is relatively stable, but there will be further additions and fixes before final release. Note that major number changes, such as version 7 to version 8, may have application programming interface (API) changes that are incompatible with the previous major version - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.0.0-alpha.1).

Notable changes to 8.0.0 since 7.3.0:

- Added `TileGrid.contains()`.
- `AnalogIn` values are full range from 0 to 65535, instead of having zeros on low-order bits.
- `OneWire` is only in `onewireio`, and is no longer in `busio` or `bitbangio`.
- `gamepadshift` has been removed: use `keypad.ShiftRegisterKeys` instead.
- `dotenv` support: `os.getenv()` values can be set in the `.env` file.

## Python 3.11 Speedup Benchmarks

[![Python 3.11 Speedup Benchmarks](../assets/20220614/20220614bench.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/06/08/python-3-11-performance-benchmarks-are-looking-fantastic-python-phoronix/)

Last month Python 3.11 Beta 1 was released as their first preview of this major update to the Python programming language. Besides new language features and other improvements, Python 3.11 performance is looking fantastic with very nice performance uplift over prior Python 3 releases. Besides changes affecting the Python language itself, Python 3.11 has been landing performance work from the ‚ÄúFaster CPython Project‚Äù to speed-up the reference implementation. Python 3.11 is 10~60% faster than Python 3.10 according to the official figures and a 1.22x speed-up with their standard benchmark suite - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/06/08/python-3-11-performance-benchmarks-are-looking-fantastic-python-phoronix/) and [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=python-311-benchmarks&num=1).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220614/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **357**!

**Updated Libraries!**

This week there were far too many updated CircuitPython libraries to include here! Keep an eye out next week for more!

## What‚Äôs the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let‚Äôs check in!

**Dan**

I fixed an ESP32SPI library problem that showed up when using an HHTP server that sent chunked responses. I also cleaned up the ESP32SPI `socket` class and removed non-standard methods. I've been working over the past two weeks on debugging more network issues that show up most prominently on the MatrixPortal.

I was able to speed up a number of CircuitPython builds by tuning the parameters for LTO optimization.

I released CircuitPython 8.0.0-alpha.1, the first published release for 8.0.0.

**Kattni**

I published the QT Py ESP32 Pico guide last week. It doesn't have CircuitPython support, but it supports Arduino, MicroPython, and Wippersnapper. It's a cute little wifi board, and if you picked one up, check out the guide for everything you need to know about it.

I did the final testing on PyLeap, and greenlit Trevor doing the release of 2.0. It's now live!

I'm working on a new guide that covers how to create, modify, and enhance your GitHub profile. GitHub has a way to create a specific repository, add a README.md file, and it renders on your GitHub main page when folks view it. This guide will explain all of that, and introduce a number of tools to make the process simple, and help you make your profile memorable and representative of you. Keep an eye out for it, and learn how to make your GitHub profile super snazzy!

**Melissa**

This past week I revisited the MIPI drivers and touchscreens and made some more progress. I tried combining the MIPI driver and the touch screen fixes the touch screen issues I was experiencing unfortunately it didn't. I've enlisted the help of the original author of the MIPI and the current FrameBuffer drivers and he is finding stuff. Once that's taken care of, I will likely go through and create and new Device Tree Overlays for each of our products that combines both the touch and MIPI drivers. 

I also played a bunch with the TSC2007 controller to try and get it operating with a kernel driver, but after having little success I decided to try using it with the simple test examples in the Guide and found it failing those. I have a new display, which was the issue, and I will continue playing with that for a bit.

**Tim**

This week I worked on modifying a slider puzzle example that I created for the PyGamer a while ago to work on a PyPortal with the touch screen instead, using the new `TileGrid.contains()` functionality recently added to the core. I made some usability improvements on circuitpython.org by adding autofocus on the search box for the downloads page, as well as a new note on the Picosystem page about how to get into bootloader. 

I'm also starting to create examples for the core module `bitmaptools`, I've created some rotation examples and experimented with scale using `bitmaptools.rotoazoom()` function. Lastly I did some testing on changes to the esp32_spi library with various different project codes.

**Scott**

This week I finished up optimizing translate function code size for non-LTO builds. The last change I did was to speed up the build process. In the end, it saved around 30 kilobytes on the ESP builds.

My main work was continuing to work on making CircuitPython auto-connect to WiFi when credentials are stored in the .env file. The first thing I've been reworking is showing connection status in the title bar of the console. With displayio, it'll change the top line to be the "title". I've also added the starting code to only reset WiFi when the user code has started it.
