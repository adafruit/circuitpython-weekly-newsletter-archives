Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! We're all coming down off the high that was CircuitPython Day at the end of last week. You can catch all the videos if you missed them. And hopefully you didn't miss that the first beta of CircuitPython 8.0.0 is now out! The new ESP32 support (the original non-suffix ones) is making waves. And check out all the rest of the content in this issue.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 0 Released! 

[![CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 0 Released](../assets/20220823/20220823cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/08/18/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-0-released/)

CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.0, a beta release for 8.0.0, is now out, merging in over 140 pull requests. It is relatively stable, but there will be further additions and fixes before final release - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/08/18/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-0-released/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.0.0-beta.0).

**Notable changes to 8.0.0 since 7.3.0**

* Added WiFi workflow with browser-based device discovery, filesystem browsing, upload, download, file editing, serial/REPL connection.
* Added a one-line status bar, which displays connection status, last exception, and version on a terminal window title or on the top line of an attached display. Support for status bar display is also being added to the Mu and Thonny editors.
* `.env` file in CIRCUITPY specifies WiFi connection parameters, BLE name, and other startup values.
* Revised Espressif camera support, now available on ESP32, ESP32-S2, and ESP32-S3.
* Added `TileGrid.contains()`.
* `AnalogIn` values are full range from 0 to 65535, instead of having zeros on low-order bits.
* `OneWire` is only in `onewireio`, and is no longer in busio or bitbangio.
* `gamepadshift` has been removed: use `keypad.ShiftRegisterKeys` instead.
* `dotenv` support: `os.getenv()` values can be set in the `.env` file.
* `PulseOut` no longer accepts a `PWMOut`. Use a `Pin` instead.
* `i2ctarget.I2CTarget` is the new name for `i2cperipheral.I2CPeripheral`. Accept both for now. `I2CPeripheral` will be removed in 9.0.0.
* Auto-brightness support in `displayio` and `framebufferio` has been removed. It was never implemented completely.
* Restored `rainbowio` and `onewireio` to a number of boards.
* Print out whole-number floats exactly and correctly.
* Enabled `collections.deque` on most builds.

**Download from circuitpython.org**

Firmware downloads are available from the [downloads page](https://circuitpython.org/downloads) on [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/). The site makes it easy to select the correct file and language for your board.

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220823/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I fixed yet more issues for CircuitPython 8.0.0 this week, most notably getting touchio to work on ESP32. I also prepared for and released 8.0.0-beta.0. The last 8.0.0 release was 8.0.0-alpha.1 over two months ago. Since then there were about 146 pull requests, so the release notes were voluminous.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [ESP32-S3 TFT Feather guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-esp32-s3-tft-feather). This massive guide is chock full of everything you need to get started with your new Feather. There's still more in the works, so keep an eye out for that guide to be updated soon!

CircuitPython Day was amazing! It was great to see how many folks showed up for the livestreams, and to be able to answer community questions where we had the opportunity. The two streams I participated in, the panel discussion and the Chat with Kattni, Jeff, and Dan, went really well. I put a significant amount of effort into coordinating CircuitPython Day as a whole, and I'm really happy with how it turned out. Thank you to all of our hosts for making the livestreams so excellent. And most importantly, thank you to the community for making all of this possible!

**Melissa**

This past week I did a ton of work on the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/). I merged the changes in that I had been working on for the past few weeks and found some JavaScript security issues on the live site that weren't present when running it from localhost on my computer. After looking at some potential solutions, I ended up creating a small JavaScript file that runs on the device and bootstraps in the entire Editor on to there. The little script worked so well that there were surprisingly few changes required to the site to get this working. If you'd like to try this out, just grab the Absolute Newest build for your ESP32 based board from [https://circuitpython.org/downloads/](https://circuitpython.org/downloads/) (assuming Web Workflow has been enabled), configure it according to the [docs](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/docs/workflows.html#web), and then browse to [http://circuitpython.local/code/](http://circuitpython.local/code/).

**Tim**

This week I finished the remaining pages on the Octopus guide and submitted it for review. I worked on github actions tasks that will measure the mpy filesize and post comments on PRs to help us better understand the size of our libraries. The initially proposed actions are submitted now as a PR to the cookie cutter repo for review and discussion. I prepared for CircuitPython day panel and game jam streams. I tinkered with PIL and am beginning to figure out how to manipulate perspective for regions of images, this will ultimately lead to a way to make customizable flip clock sprites for use with displayio.

**Scott**

This was my last week before I take 12 weeks to care for my kiddo. (Yay paternity leave!) My main goal was to wrap up outstanding web workflow changes and work with Melissa on integrating the web workflow into code.circuitpython.org. Due to browser restrictions, we weren't able to get code.circuitpython.org working. However, the devices themselves now have a http://circuitpython.local/code/ page that loads the full code.cp.org experience when online. Thanks to Melissa for her hard work getting that going.

The main thing I did was to add one final API piece for moving/renaming files through the REST API. RetiredWizard was super helpful in testing it. I also added the ability to upload a complete directory. I fixed an issue on the S2 where the code wouldn't start up, it'd just crash. Thanks to everyone for testing and reviews. Thanks to Dan for releasing CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.0!

Thanks to Kattni for orchestrating an awesome CircuitPython Day 2022.

Thank you all. I'll be back to working on CP on November 14th.

**Liz**

I've been working on a third CircuitPython and Microsoft Azure project. This time I used IoT Hub with multiple ESP32-S2 devices running CircuitPython connected and sending telemetry. A Raspberry Pi is pulling the feeds from IoT Hub and displaying them on a monitor using the [Blinka_Displayio_PyGameDisplay library](https://github.com/FoamyGuy/Blinka_Displayio_PyGameDisplay).
