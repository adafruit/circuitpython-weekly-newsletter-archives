Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! A great deal is happening in the Python world to include Python on Microcontrollers. This week, CircuitPython hit the 350 library mark - thousands of lines of open source code allowing anyone to connect things, make graphics, measure and crunch. Welcome to the latest issue, there is something of interest for everyone.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## 350 CircuitPython Libraries Are Now Available

[![350 CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220412/20220412lib.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/08/350-circuitpython-libraries-circuitpython/)

The CircuitPython community reached a big milestone together Thursday! There are now 350 CircuitPython Libraries!

The Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle and Community Library Bundle contain all the current libraries available for CircuitPython. CircuitPython libraries are separate files designed to work with CircuitPython code.

CircuitPython programs require a lot of information to run. CircuitPython is so simple to use because most of this information is processed in the background and stored in libraries. Some libraries are built into CircuitPython. Others are downloaded and stored on your CIRCUITPY drive in a folder called lib.

[![CircuitPython Library Growth](../assets/20220412/20220412chart.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/08/350-circuitpython-libraries-circuitpython/)

Growth is steady and healthy for the project - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/08/350-circuitpython-libraries-circuitpython/).

The full list of all the CircuitPython libraries contained in the library bundle can be found on the [circuitpython.org libraries page](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

## CircuitPython 7.3.0-beta.1 Released

[![CircuitPython 7.3.0-beta.1](../assets/20220412/20220412cp7.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases)

A new version of CircuitPython came out last week – CircuitPython 7.3.0-beta.1.

Notable changes to 7.3.0 since 7.2.5:

* Experimental mDNS support.
* USB to Serial/JTAG support for REPL on appropriate boards.
* Initial experimental USB host support.
* Merge MicroPython 1.18 changes.
* Preliminary `zlib` module support. `gzip` module will be added later.
* PIO: `wrap` and `wrap_target` support.
* `keypad`: scan keystates immediately on creation.

## Python 3.11 to be Twice as Fast as its Predecessors

[![Python 3.11](../assets/20220412/20220412p3.jpg)](https://python.plainenglish.io/python-3-11-to-be-twice-as-fast-as-predecessors-156768bc3d4)

The upcoming version of Python is set to be twice as fast as the previous versions. Python creator Guido Van Rossum stated at the last Python Language Summit that when version 3.11 is published in October 2022, he plans to quadruple Python’s speed. His overall goal over the next four years is to boost Python’s speed by a factor of five.

> Van Rossum’s presentation, which is available on [Github](https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/blob/main/FasterCPythonDark.pdf) details how he plans to do this, including an adaptive bytecode interpreter, frame stack optimization, and ‘zero overhead’ exception handling. If these changes double Python’s speed, Van Rossum believes that future changes may include a solid ABI (application binary interface) or machine code generation to boost Python’s performance even more.

Adafruit found the [GUVB-C31](https://www.digikey.com/short/088zdvb8) and [GUVA-C32](https://www.digikey.com/short/wj29qtvr) tucked in the Digi-Key catalog. These are UV sensors with true UV diodes and tuned for different spectra. Adafruit is always getting requests for true UV sensors, and these could be useful particularly given the different responsivity. The GUVB is good for ~250 to 320nm, the GUVA is ~250 to 370nm and can output UV index as well it seems. They’ve never seen this chip used but they are whipping up a quick breakout and will try it to see how well they work - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/06/coming-soon-qt-uv-sensor-in-two-flavors/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added (we had nine last week!).

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **350**!

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

There are too many updated libraries to list this week. Keep an eye out for more library fun next week!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.2.5 to fix various high priority bugs, and also 7.3.0-beta.1 to catch up on two weeks' worth of additions and fixes to the `main` branch. 7.3.0-beta.1 also includes all the 7.2.x fixes.

One of the fixes for 7.2.5 was particularly head-scratching. I could make CircuitPython hang simply by touching an unconnected UART RX pin. This turned out to be a particular timeout UART interrupt enabled in the latest version of the RP2040 SDK, which we didn't know about and didn't handle.

I am continuing on the bug quest for 7.2.x and 7.3.0. The latest interesting thing is that stepper motors driven by an I2C-controlled motor controller are running much more slowly on ESP32-S2 that on other ports. I suspect an I2C problem.

**Jeff**

I contributed some more bug fixes for the recent 7.2.x releases, and also fixed some bugs that will go in 7.3.0 whenever that is released. It's good to be getting through the backlog of things that had accumulated for me to work on in CircuitPython.

**Kattni**

I've been working on a number of things over the last week. The asyncio template is completed, and ready to be included in its first guide. I created a new `.gitignore` for the libraries, and had it peer reviewed via a cookiecutter PR. (We will need to run a patch to deploy it to all the libraries.) I proofed Liz's first product guide (she did great!). I started testing PyLeap, found some issues, determined at least one of them is a CircuitPython-issue (not a PyLeap one), and submitted feedback on some of the new mockups that are destined for the next PyLeap version.

Coming up is the Feather ESP32-S3 guide, the QT Py BFF guide, and who knows!

**Melissa**

This past week I focused on archiving the WebSerial ESPTool, updating guides, and updating WipperSnapper Firmware Uploader. We are making use of a fork of the tool that NabuCasa is maintaining at https://nabucasa.github.io/esp-web-flasher/. Their fork has it available as an NPM module and WipperSnapper Firmware Uploader has now been updated to use the NPM module.

**Tim**

I created some preliminary material for use by folks at an upcoming python convention. A YouTube video showing the process of adding type hints to a CircuitPython library, as well as a Learn Guide page that explains type hints and how we use them in CircuitPython libraries. I also tinkered with some helper code to generate larger panels from small sprite sheets using `displayio.TileGrid`.

**Liz**

This week I worked on my first new product guide solo for the TSC2007, following Kattni's expert guidance. I also finished up a project guide, using a QT Py ESP32-S2 to control a Pure Data patch over WiFi with a socket connection (https://learn.adafruit.com/wireless-esp32-s2-controller-for-pure-data). This coming week I'll be working on another wireless project, this time using BLE for an HID device.
