## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I made releases for both CircuitPython 7.1.0 final and 7.2.0-alpha.1 on Tuesday, December 28, 2021. 7.1.0 is a new stable release. 7.1.0-rc.0 had some mild changes, resulting in 7.1.0-rc.1, and 7.1.0-rc.1 seemed to be fine, so we re-released it as 7.1.0 final.

I'll be working on more `asyncio` examples for the [Cooperative Multitasking](https://learn.adafruit.com/cooperative-multitasking-in-circuitpython-with-asyncio) guide, and considering some new features for it as well.

**Jeff**

Rather than take on any substantial coding work, I instead finished up a 3D printed project with LEDs. A guide for making your own will probably be published on the Learn system by the time you read this, check for a link in the new guides section of the newsletter.

I've also taken some time to reflect on what we've accomplished together in 2021. For me, some of the high points of progress have been adding asyncio, getting "up to date" with MicroPython, and adding support for fun hardware like camera modules.

On a personal note, I'm grateful to get to know Damien and Jimmo from the MicroPython project a little better, and that I was able to visit Adafruit in NYC and participate in-person on an Ask an Engineer broadcast.

Thank you to everyone who has shared their CircuitPython projects in this newsletter, on Discord, Twitter, and elsewhere. It's incredible and humbling to know that I have played some small role in these meaningful, creative, insightful and inspiring projects.

**Scott**

This is a short week for me because I'm taking two days off around the holidays. The last two days have been spent working on Raspberry Pi Zero support for CircuitPython. This will broaden the supported boards and hopefully provide some perspective on the SD card issues that have been plaguing the broadcom port. I'm debugging the Zero support today and will hopefully get it going and out for merge today. :crossed_fingers:

I'll be kicking off #CircuitPython2022, so start brainstorming where you want CP to go in the new year.
