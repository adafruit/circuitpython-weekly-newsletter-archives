Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Nothing is perfect and that includes the software we use. Both CircuitPython and MicroPython got a bump this last week to fix edge case usage. Question of the week - should GitHub use your code in Copilot without attribution (if so licensed)? And as always much more, so have a peek and have a great week!

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## CircuitPython 7.3.1 Released

[![CircuitPython 7.3.1](../assets/20220628/20220628cp7.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/06/22/circuitpython-7-3-1-released/)

CircuitPython 7.3.1 is the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython and is the new stable release - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/06/22/circuitpython-7-3-1-released/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases).

Notable changes to 7.3.1 since 7.3.0:

* Adafruit MatrixPortal: fix ESP32SPI hang.
* Espressif: fix use of multiple rotaryio.IncrementalEncoder objects.
* nRF: fix crash when waking up from sleep when a display is in use.
* Update frozen libraries, especially Circuit Playground Express.

## MicroPython v1.19.1 Released

[![MicroPython v1.19.1 Released](../assets/20220628/20220628mp119.jpg)](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.19.1)

MicroPython v1.19.1 is the current release of MicroPython, it is a bug fix release - [GitHub](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.19.1).

Changes from 1.19 to 1.19.1:

- extmod/machine_i2c: only use WRITE1 option if transfer supports it.

This fixes the machine.SoftI2C.readfrom_mem() method on esp32, so it writes the address to read from.

## GitHub Copilot to Become a Paid Service August 23rd

[![GitHub Copilot](../assets/20220628/20220628copilot.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/06/22/github-copilot-to-become-a-paid-service-august-23rd-github/)

GitHub Copilot will cost USD $10 a month or USD $100 a year starting August 23rd with a free 60 day trial available. GitHub is betting big on AI programming and code in the cloud, according to GitHub CEO [Thomas Dohmke](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/06/22/github-copilot-to-become-a-paid-service-august-23rd-github/#:~:text=GitHub%20CEO%C2%A0Thomas%20Dohmke), who spoke at the [WeAreDevelopers](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/) conference recently.

People have flocked to social media, with many upset that their code, with licenses that may not be free and open (or at least require attribution) was used to train Copilot, which does not provide any hint at where the code has come from - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/06/22/github-copilot-to-become-a-paid-service-august-23rd-github/) and [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/).

[![Stack Overflow Developer Survey](../assets/20220628/20220628survey.jpg)](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-popular-technologies)

The 2022 Stack Overflow Developers Survey contains many insights into how the developer community is doing. One of the results to highlight: what languages are people learning to code with: - [Stack Overflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-popular-technologies).

> 2022 marks JavaScript’s tenth year in a row as the most commonly used programming language. But, it’s a different picture for those learning to code. HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Python are almost tied as the most popular languages for people learning to code. People learning to code are more likely than Professional Developers to report using Python (58% vs 44%), C++ (35% vs 20%), and C (32% vs 17%).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.3.1 this week. It includes the MatrixPortal DMA SPI fix I did last week, and several other fixes, some of which were backported from the `main` branch.

I've started to port CircuitPython to run on plain ESP32 microcontrollers, which don't have native USB support. The web workflow Scott is working on will make these quite usable, so we've decided to support these widely used chips.

**Kattni**

I wrapped up the [Create an Excellent GitHub Profile with Markdown](https://learn.adafruit.com/excellent-github-profile) guide. It explains the steps necessary to create a GitHub profile including creating the special profile repository with a README. It also covers some basic Markdown syntax, and how to edit the README. Then, the guide discusses what kind of content you might want to include to get you started if you're unsure where to begin. Finally, there is a section on creating your profile, beginning with the simplest option and moving through more advanced options, including a number of tools to add some enhancements to your profile. Whether this is entirely new to you, or you want to put some shine on your existing profile, this guide is meant for you!

**Tim**

I worked on an HTML page served by devices for editing files via the web workflow. I was able to integrate the page with some of the HTTP Request endpoints that Scott has set up on the working branch for web workflow to load and save files. I experimented with Javascript code editor modules and used one called "Ace" on the page which offers syntax highlighting, line numbers, and other code editing "quality of life" features. This week I also added some integer bounds validation on the arguments for a few of the functions on displayio.Palette object in the core. Previously it would allow values outside the range of indexes within the palette. Whilst adding these validations I learned about QTSTRs from some Micropython documentation to better understand where they come from and how to use them.

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on the web workflow. I've added basic auth permissions to the file access, the ability to upload files, delete them and create directories. I also got it doing CORS headers so that other approved sites will be able to fetch data from the board. I'm continuing to polish things and will hopefully send out a PR early next week. The PR will cover device discovery and file system operations. Serial support will be added in a following PR.

**Liz**

I've been working on a cassette hacking project with JP. We are doing two different versions to demonstrate to folks how to control off the shelf tape decks for weird music effects with CircuitPython. My version is using a simple L9110 motor driver. A potentiometer affects the speed and direction of the motor in the cassette deck. I made a tape loop so that it can play forward and reverse without any issues. I think this guide will be really helpful for folks because you see a lot of tape projects out there in the music tech/synth communities, but you don't see a lot of step-by-step documentation on how to get started. This has also been nostalgic for me because I spent a lot of time making tapes up until 2018 because my car only had a tape deck that did not get along with the infamous iPod tape deck adapter. 

I also wrapped up the WipperSnapper pages for the [QT Py ESP32-S3 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py-esp32-s3) and wrote some code for the [PyPortal Smart Mirror Weather Display guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/smart-mirror-with-pyportal).
