Thank you to all the people who have chosen to star the CircuitPython code repository - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/05/27/circuitpython-reaches-3000-stars-on-github-circuitpython-github-adafruit/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/stargazers).

## Make: Boards Guide Reviews the Adafruit Metro ESP32-S2

[![Adafruit Metro ESP32-S2](../assets/20220601/20220601metro.jpg)](https://makezine.com/products/boards/adafruit-metro-esp32-s2/)

Make reviews the Adafruit Metro ESP32-S2 microcontroller board - [Makezine](https://makezine.com/products/boards/adafruit-metro-esp32-s2/).

> The Adafruit Metro ESP32-S2 packages the best features of Adafruit’s recent microcontroller boards in a traditional Arduino Uno form factor. The heart of the board, the Espressif ESP32-S2, improves on the ESP line of Wi-Fi-enabled microcontrollers by adding native USB support. The addition of USB mass storage to the platform allows drag-and-drop deployment of Adafruit’s [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/), making the board very easy to program. It also allows the board to act as a USB input device (HID).

## Projects of the Week: Raspberry Pi Based Python Cyberdecks

### Pico Programming Python Cyberdeck

[![Pico Programming Python Cyberdeck](../assets/20220601/20220601potw.jpg)](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-portable-cyberdeck)

Here is a portable pocket-sized Pi Zero 2 W cyberdeck from maker Chris Remboldt designed for creating even more fun Pi projects. Remboldt says the idea was to make something easy to take with him for Python coding practice that would also allow him to connect and tinker with the Raspberry Pi Pico.

On its own, he can use the handheld cyberdeck to create and run Python scripts. But thanks to its USB hub, Remboldt can connect external peripherals like a Raspberry Pi Pico or any other RP2040 board for prototyping projects while out and about or at least away from a power outlet - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisRemboldt/status/1529823398548807684) and [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-portable-cyberdeck).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were two additional boards added:

- [MixGo CE Serial](https://circuitpython.org/board/mixgo_ce_serial/)
- [Maker Zero SAMD21](https://circuitpython.org/board/cytron_maker_zero_samd21/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220601/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **357**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

I released CircuitPython 7.3.0 final. Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release! We have one known regression from 7.2.5, involving multiple rotary encoders on Espressif boards, which I fixed. I will wait a few days to see what else comes up before doing a 7.3.1.

I've incorporated some of the incompatible changes we planned to make for 8.0.0 onto the `main` branch.

I'm looking at speeding up the GitHub Actions runs by not using the LTO compilation option when not necessary, and changing some LTO settings as well, when space is not at an absolute premium.

I'm also still working on fixing some ESP32SPI problems.

The last week has been mostly miscellaneous and a couple of new guides. There is a guide in progress about how to add a project to PyLeap. 

I started the Adafruit QT Py ESP32 Pico guide. It will have everything you need to get started with the QT Py ESP32 Pico. The plan was to publish it before today, however, I ran into difficulties with relying on Liz to do all my testing since I don't have the hardware. It is now on its way here, so I'll be finishing that up once I have it in hand.

**Melissa**

This past week I finished going through guide feedback for guides that I had previously worked on updating, but were under another author's name. After that was finished, I went through and updated the [Introducing Adafruit Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather) guide with all the new Feathers and FeatherWings that had come out since the guide was last updated, which was not long before I started working with Adafruit.

I tested a network requests issue when making repeated requests to a nodeJS server, I tried with an ESP32-S2 based device to determine if the issue was specific to ESP32SPI or not. I also did some testing and made a PR to resolve a core issue that causes reduced brightness range on the PyPortal Titano display. I'm working on making TileGrid objects have a `contains()` method similar to the Display Button library so that any Bitmap, OnDiskBitmap or other thing that uses TileGrid can be easily integrated with touch interaction. 

**Scott**

This week I've been running some analysis on CircuitPython binaries to try and find some code to remove. I've learned a lot about the ELF file format but haven't found anything significant. My work is in the [elf-section-graph repo](https://github.com/adafruit/elf-section-graph). After visualizing it with Gephi, I've moved to a simpler treemap visualization that is common to look at how big folders and subtrees are. To make viewing a treemap, I created https://treemap.dev. It will make it easy to view treemaps.

I haven't quite finished my DotEnv work because Dan found a bug (thank you!). I hope to squash it tomorrow and get it checked in.

After that I'll be continuing to work on the web workflow when not taking care of our new baby.

**Liz**

This past week I wrapped up the [traffic light conference badge guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/traffic-light-conference-badge), a guide for [installing drivers for WCH USB to serial chips](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-install-drivers-for-wch-usb-to-serial-chips/overview) and a getting started guide for the [NAU7802 STEMMA board](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-nau7802-24-bit-adc-stemma-qt-qwiic). Big thanks to Kattni for walking through the Mac install steps for the WCH driver and getting screenshots.

This coming week I'll be working on some CircuitPython IoT projects. I'm going to be doing some projects using Azure and I'll be doing a project with the Ruiz brothers for a weather display. I'll also be working on a new product guide for the QT Py ESP32-S3. It will be my first new dev board guide.
