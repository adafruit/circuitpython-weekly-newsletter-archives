Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Another busy week leading up to the holidays. Apple has finally performed some bug fixes for loading UF2 files onto microcontrollers but work remains with hex files. The Adafruit PyLeap application now makes it easier to load code onto wireless microcontroller. Grab a free PDF copy of the Raspberry Pi Handbook 2023 to check out the latest on their boards. And check out all the projects this week, including some very imaginative ones - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Issue Uploading UF2 files with macOS 13.0 Ventura Fixed in Version 13.1

[![Uploading UF2 files with macOS](../assets/20221220/20221220uf2.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/31/uploading-uf2-files-with-macos-13-0-ventura-apple-microbit_edu-raspberry_pi-circuitpython/)

Uploading UF2 file issues with macOS 13.0 Ventura have been fixed in Version 13.1. Not all is perfect, though. It is still the case that UF2 uploading does not work on nRF52840 boards that use an older UF2 bootloader (versions 0.6.2 and newer work). On those boards, the bootloader appears to fail quickly. Copying a UF2 file does not work, which is indicated by the UF2 filename appearing in the BOOT drive. The bootloader can be updated by following the directions [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/blob/master/README.md#flash). Otherwise, on these nRF52840 boards, including the Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit, the Feather nRF52840, and the ItsyBitsy nRF52840, the only way to load a UF2 file is to use a non-Ventura computer.

It is also still true that copying .hex files larger than 1MB does not work (e.g., on the micro:bit). See https://github.com/ARMmbed/DAPLink/issues/982 for workarounds and further investigation - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/31/uploading-uf2-files-with-macos-13-0-ventura-apple-microbit_edu-raspberry_pi-circuitpython/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/the-ventura-problem/).

## PyLeap Gets a Major Update – Now With WiFi Transfer and More!

[![PyLeap Gets a Major Update](../assets/20221220/20221220pyleap.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/12/19/pyleap-gets-a-major-update-now-with-wi-fi-transfer-and-more/)

A major update for PyLeap, the free Adafruit iOS app that simplifies downloading code files and assets and transferring them to Adafruit devices using BLE.

With this update, Adafruite added the ability for users to transfer files using WiFi in addition to BLE. This means that you can now transfer your code and assets to your Adafruit devices even faster without having to rely on a physical connection (like USB).

But that’s not all – they’ve also made several other improvements and enhancements to PyLeap to make it even more user-friendly and efficient. Some of the other highlights of this update include:

* Enhanced transfer speeds: the transfer process has been optimized to make it even faster, so you can get your code and assets onto your Adafruit devices very quickly.
* More devices supported: added support for some new Adafruit devices, so you can use PyLeap with even more hardware.

Overall, this update to PyLeap makes it even more convenient and efficient for developers and makers to transfer code and assets to their Adafruit devices.

Download PyLeap today! [PyLeap App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pyleap/id1582204203) and see the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/12/19/pyleap-gets-a-major-update-now-with-wi-fi-transfer-and-more/).

## New 3D Printing Model Website: Printables

[![Printables](../assets/20221220/20221220print.jpg)](https://blog.prusa3d.com/starting-a-3d-printing-revolution-introducing-official-brand-profiles-on-printables-com_73408/)

For better or worse, many of the 3D printable cases, parts and more have been placed on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/), controlled by MakerBot. A new model aggregator has emerged with the backing from prominent content creators including Adafruit: Printables by Prusa  - [Prusa](https://blog.prusa3d.com/starting-a-3d-printing-revolution-introducing-official-brand-profiles-on-printables-com_73408/).

> Wouldn’t it be great, if you could download official 3D printable files with replacement parts and accessories for your home appliances? Or an official fan model from your favorite game? Today, with our partners from various industries, we’re turning this into reality and starting a revolution in how big brands approach 3D printing!  All 3D models shared on [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/) are available for free, allowing anyone to easily download and print them at home. This opens up a world of possibilities for businesses and consumers alike. Some replacement parts can be printed locally and on-demand, eliminating the need for inventory and shipping. This also makes it easier for brands to support the right-to-repair initiative. In addition to replacement parts, businesses can also create accessories and mods for their products. This allows consumers to personalize and improve their products, making them even more valuable and unique. And for fans of popular games and movies, brands can create official fan models, such as figures, costumes, and props.

## RISC-V: The background, the benefits, and the future

[![RISC-V: The background, the benefits, and the future](../assets/20221220/20221220r5.jpg)](https://www.eeworldonline.com/risc-v-background-benefits-and-future-faq/)

US developers conceived the revolutionary instruction set architecture (ISA) known as RISC-V in 2010. Grounded in reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles, it’s a common, open-source, and completely free ISA that can be used to develop software and hardware. These attributes are just part of what makes the architecture unique and attractive to developers and manufacturers.

While it’s far from new, momentum around RISC-V is continuing to accelerate, with various services, technologies, and products that leverage this architecture emerging in the past year alone. According to Deloitte, use of RISC-V’s open-chip processors was expected to double this year and is set to double again in 2023 - [EEWorld](https://www.eeworldonline.com/risc-v-background-benefits-and-future-faq/).

## Project of the Week: A Runner's Headlight

[![Runner's Headlight](../assets/20221220/20221220run.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CmKbKJCKh0v/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY%3D)

The Metanerd Headlight Mk. 2

> The Mk. 1 was a success in the sense that it was made entirely from leftover parts from unrelated earlier projects, but I wasn't really satisfied with the design.
Particularly the area around the two close range LEDs bothered me and I also felt like it could be a little more compact.<br>&nbsp; <br>Enter Mk. 2. Not only is it physically smaller and uses less power, it also looks much more professionally designed. It has the same control and the same mix of close and long range lights. Close range: 2 x 1W with 90 deg lens and angled down 15 degrees to illuminate the ground immediately in front of and around me. Long range: 1 x 3W with 5 degree lens for a focused cone of light so I can see far ahead.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I've been researching and fixing a variety of issues for the CircuitPython 8.0.0 release. Some issues were fixed easily, some were not reproducible, and some I moved forward, past 8.0.0. We have about a dozen issues open: the number goes up and down, but the trend is down!

**Kattni**

This week I collaborated with Liz to publish the [EYESPI Breakout Board](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-eyespi-breakout-board) guide. It has everything you need to get started with your EYESPI breakout. If you picked one of these up and need more info or a little help getting started, check out this guide!

The next guide is a scrolling countdown timer using three quad alphanumeric STEMMA QT display backpacks, and a QT Py ESP32-S2. You can customise it for any event you would like to count down to, and it scrolls the time left until that event, as well as displaying any message you choose when the event starts. 

**Melissa**

I've been out most of the past week due to the death of a close friend. Prior to that I was working on updating code.circuitpython.org and rewriting the USB workflow to make use of the File System Access api. The initial pull request was merged in and I have been working on polishing the changes up to make the USB workflow even more usable.

**Tim**

I have been working on helper functions that generate lists of colors representing a gradient between two or more given input colors. I've implemented 3 different types of increasing complexity: linear, polylinear, and bezier gradients. I have experimented with visualizing with displayio and vectorio. I'm hoping to use the gradients with neopixels and led_animation ultimately as well.

**Jeff**

The `settings.toml` change I mentioned in the last newsletter has finally been merged, and will be in *beta.6* and newer! Aside from that, I worked on some hidden problems with building CircuitPython that was a pre-existing problem that was exposed when a new version of isort was released.

Here's a quick tutorial on `settings.toml`:
 * Just like the removed `.env` support, these values are used e.g., to set up the web workflow, or can be retrieved with a call to `os.getenv()`
 * CircuitPython supports a subset of the full toml syntax.
 * It supports simple string and integer values
 * It supports comments which start with "#"
 * Each line should be of the form "NAME=value".
 * String values have to be enclosed in double quotes (`NAME="string value"`). You can directly use non-ASCII characters like œ or 🎉 as long as you save in UTF-8 format. Or, you can use non-ascii characters with a `\uxxxx` 4-digit code.
 * Integers must *not* be quoted. They may be in decimal or hexadecimal format only. (`NAME=42`)
 * A non-supported value type *that is written on a single line* will not cause a compatibility problem. However, trying to retrieve the value will generally result in an exception
 * A non-supported value *that is written on multiple lines* (like triple quoted strings) can cause a problem if one of the contained lines looks like a supported `NAME=value` line.
 * Parsing ends at a line that starts with `[`.

We'll be updating our guides and sample code that referred to `.env` to reflect the new `settings.toml` way of doing things shortly after the release of beta.6.

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on the coprocessor/ULP support for the ESP32-S2 and S3. I've been testing a ULP program that reads a pin input and then wakes up the main core when the pin goes low. It now works during pretend deep sleep but not full deep sleep. Once I get that working, I hope to send out the pull request.

**Liz**

I worked on the [EYESPI breakout board guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-eyespi-breakout-board) with Kattni. It gives a basic overview on how to use the EYESPI breakout and EYESPI connector port on the newer SPI displays in the shop. I'd always avoided SPI displays in the past because of the wiring but this breakout with the FPC cable makes everything a lot simpler. I think folks will especially find this standard to be especially useful for cyberdecks.

I also worked on the [MOSFET Driver Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mosfet-driver). This breakout has the MOSFET diode circuit that is needed for driving things like high power LED's, motors and solenoids. The terminal block onboard is very fancy and provides a sturdy connection.
