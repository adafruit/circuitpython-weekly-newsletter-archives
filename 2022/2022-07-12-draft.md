Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! The Raspberry Pi Pico W continues to dominate the news with many makers using them for projects. Eben Upton states two million will be made before the end of 2022. CircuitPython Day 2022 has been announced for August with virtual events in the works. Do browse all the projects, there is a wide variety this week.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Announcing CircuitPython Day 2022 - August 19th

[![CircuitPython Day 2022](../assets/20220712/20220712cpd.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/07/11/announcing-circuitpython-day-2022-on-august-19th-circuitpythonday2022-circuitpython-python/)

Friday August 19 (8/19/2022) is CircuitPython Day 2022, being designated the snakiest day this year! The day highlights all things CircuitPython and Python on Hardware.

Working with CircuitPython? Tag your projects #CircuitPythonDay2022 on social media and Adafruit will look to highlight them.

Special events will be held during the day - keep an eye on Adafruit social media channels for announcements - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/07/11/announcing-circuitpython-day-2022-on-august-19th-circuitpythonday2022-circuitpython-python/).

## Now you can simulate circuits with Fritzing!

[![Simulate circuits with Fritzing](../assets/20220712/20220712fritz.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/07/05/now-you-can-simulate-circuits-with-fritzing-fritzing-fritzingorg/)

After many requests and years of waiting, Fritzing finally got a simulator!

The primary purpose of the simulator is to teach electronics to beginners, and its current capabilities are very limited (only analysis of DC circuits). However, it is fully functional, easy to use, and works on the breadboard and schematic view. In addition, it performs some checks to see if any parts are working outside their specifications - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/07/05/now-you-can-simulate-circuits-with-fritzing-fritzing-fritzingorg/), [announcement post](https://blog.fritzing.org/2022/06/27/Simulating-Circuits-with-Fritzing) and [download page](https://fritzing.org/download/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there was one new board added:

- [RP2040-Shim](https://circuitpython.org/board/silicognition-rp2040-shim/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220712/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **357**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm continuing on plain ESP32 support for CircuitPython, and am currently debugging uploads from Thonny and other upload-over-serial file managers.

**Jeff**

One of the things we want to upgrade in CircuitPython version 8 is ulab; there are a lot of bugfixes and improvements in the current version. To that end, I've filed a pull request to bring in all those changes. In the process, I got to learn some interesting things about how different CircuitPython platforms, such as broadcom, deal with floating point numbers! Hopefully this PR will be merged soon.

**Kattni**

This week I published two guides: [Create an Excellent GitHub Profile with Markdown](https://learn.adafruit.com/excellent-github-profile) and [GitHub Actions Status Tower Light](https://learn.adafruit.com/github-actions-status-tower-light). 

The Create an Excellent GitHub Profile with Markdown guide covers everything you need to know to get from start to finish creating a GitHub profile that is both memorable and representative of you. Even if you're brand new to GitHub, this guide has you covered. Check it out!

The GitHub Actions Status Tower Light guide shows you how to use a USB-controlled tower light to keep track of your latest GitHub Actions run on any repo you customise the code to query. Gone are the days of keeping endless tabs open to keep up with your Actions statuses. Let the light do the work for you!

**Melissa**

I'm back this week and and have caught up on my messages. After I finished that, I started familiarizing myself with the Web Workflow that Scott has been working on and looking into an issue where the ESP Web Tool was writing to the ESP32-C3, but the written image wasn't working.

**Tim**

I did get done was on the Game & Watch Octopus game for PyGamer. The components that control the more complex behaviors in the game are complete now and the most basic game mode has been implemented. The remaining programming work is to finish up the second game mode and verify that my implementation is matching the original as best as possible, then work on the guide that will cover the process of making the game. 

**Scott**

This week I'm wrapping up WebSocket support in CircuitPython. WebSockets allow browsers to have a serial connection over the network. I've got it sending and receiving characters from a test page. I need to enhance the page a little to better handle control characters and make input simpler. Once I'm happy with it, I'll be making a PR. I'm excited to see what folks do with it.

This week I am working on the food scale project with the NAU7802. I was able to code up a UI with CircuitPython that uses two alphanumeric displays and two LED buttons. You can scroll through a menu of modes, show the weight in grams or ounces, zero out the NAU7802, fully calibrate the scale and show the current offset value. During calibration mode, you press one of the buttons to advance to the next step. Since it involves clearing the scale and placing an item with a known weight on it, I didn't want to rely on hardcoded delays. I think that this could be a good example for folks who want to build projects that need calibration or resets.

## Upcoming events!
