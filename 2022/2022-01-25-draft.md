Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Python continues to be increasingly used for microcontroller projects, large and small. It's great to see the innovation in this area. This issue highlights some of the work published this week.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## The Raspberry Pi Pico / RP2040 Turns One Year Old

[![Pico](../assets/20220125/20220125pico.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/multilingual-blink-for-raspberry-pi-pico/)

About a year ago, Raspberry Pi released a new type of product - their first microcontroller: the RP2040 and a development board which uses it: the Raspberry Pi Pico. Usage by the electronics and hobbyist community has been quick due to great functionality at a great price point (and it has generally remained available during the silicon shortage).

Maker companies were quick to release RP2040 boards of their own, including Adafruit, SparkFun, Pimoroni and many more as well as smaller companies and individuals. Scores of designs rely on this versitile chip to perform some remarkable tasks. With lots of RAM, Flash, dual cores, and user programmable PIO, this chip packs a punch.

## A Study in the Popularity of the CircuitPython GitHub Repository

[![CircuitPython GitHub Repository Popularity](../assets/20220125/20220125star.jpg)](https://star-history.com/#adafruit/circuitpython&Date)

An interesting look at the number of GitHub Stars awarded to the Adafruit [CircuitPython GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython). Marked increases on the dates that the Adafruit PyPortal (2019) and the Raspberry Pi Pico (2021) were released. CircuitPython enjoys increased usage in many segments of the embedded ecosphere - [Star-History](https://star-history.com/#adafruit/circuitpython&Date).

## Yes, MicroPython Works on MS-DOS Too

[![MicroPython Works on MS-DOS](../assets/20220125/20220125dos.jpg)](https://twitter.com/zoomosis/status/1343505245742088197)

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added, but several are in development.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220125/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **344**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.1.1, mainly to fix using the microphone on the CircuitPython Playground Express.

I'm working on presenting more than on filesystem via USB. I previously thought this was much more difficult than it actually is. A single USB Mass Storage device can present multiple "logical units": each of those will appear as a drive. With only a few new lines of code, I made a PyPortal show CIRCUITPY and the SD card filesystem as two different drives. This is easiest on Linux, which notices when a filesystem appears on another logical unit and mounts it automatically. Windows and macOS unfortunately don't mount the new drive automatically unless I completely disconnect and reconnect USB. I can do that programmatically ,but I'll see if there's an easier way.

**Jeff**

Work on floppy drive interfacing continues, but there's not a whole lot of visible progress within CircuitPython. Behind the scenes, I've been laying groundwork that I hope will enable writing MFM data, but that's still out in the future.

**Kattni**

This week I added the boot button pin to the TFT Feather, and updated the pinouts and PrettyPins diagrams to include it. We are now sponsoring Read the Docs, where all of our documentation is hosted, which comes with a couple of perks. All of our docs are now ad-free. As well, I worked with our web devs to get the new [docs.circuitpython.org](https://docs.circuitpython.org) URL set up. We're now working to get all the libraries updated to use the new URL. And finally, I continued work on the QT Py ESP32-S2 guide - it should be completed by the time this is published!

**Melissa**

This past week, I continued working on porting LittleFS to JavaScript. It turns out it's a bigger project than I initially thought, but I also have no doubts about it being possible, which is helpful. This week, I have enough done where I'm getting some file output, but there's also still a lot left to convert before I get the full and correct output.

**Scott**

This has been a little bit shorter week. I've gotten back into ESP32-S3 work over the last week. I've been doing bug fixing for the ESP32-S3:
* Thanks to Ivan (@igrr) at Espressif I fixed WiFi on the S3 and it may work on the C3 too.
* I added a C3 board definition for the Espressif devkit too.
* @ladyada found a crash with WiFi that I hopefully fixed as well. It was actually due to running CircuitPython on the second core. It's the first multicore bug in CircuitPython that I've fixed.
* The S3 devkit has been blinding me due to a NeoPixel bug that I've just about fixed as well.

My main work is adding BLE support to the S3. My first task is to get it all stubbed out but compiling and running. That will allow me to add functionality piece by piece rather than having to convert everything all at once. Advertising and scanning will be my first step after that.
