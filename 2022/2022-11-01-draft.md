Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! This issue finishes the builds community makers have done with Pythonn for Halloween. I expect hliday themed projects to come out, perhaps after a short break. Beta 4 for PCircuitPython 8.0.0 fixes the ESP32-C2 issue and adds a RasPI Pico web server capability among other fixes. macOS Ventura has a bug affecting file transfers for UF2 and hex files used by microcontrollers. And so much more - have fun checking them out - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Halloween Round-Up

This Halloween (October 31st) has seen a bonanza of maker projects and so many of them used Python, MicroPython or CircuitPython. It appears using Python and current hardware is making it easier for people to make creative, feature-rich projects.

## CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 4 Released

[![CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 4 Released](../assets/20221101/20221101cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/30/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-4-released/)

CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.4 was just released. It is relatively stable, but there will be further additions and fixes before final release - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/30/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-4-released/) and [Release Notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases).

WARNING: The flash partitioning for 2MB and 4MB flash ESP32 and ESP32-C3 boards has changed since 8.0.0-beta.2. When you load 8.0.0-beta.3 or later over beta.2 (or vice versa), on these boards, CIRCUITPY will be erased and reformatted. Also: The flash partitioning for the Raspberry Pi Pico W has changed since 8.0.0-beta.1. When you load 8.0.0-beta.2 or later over beta.1 (or vice versa), on the Pico W, CIRCUITPY will be erased and reformatted.

**Notable changes since 8.0.0-beta.3**

* ESP32-C3 builds now work again.
* Raspberry Pi Pico W can act as a server, and can use static IP addresses.

## macOS Ventura Released, Breaks UF2 File Copy

[![macOS Ventura Breaks UF2 File Copy](../assets/20221101/20221101mac.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/31/uploading-uf2-files-with-macos-13-0-ventura-apple-microbit_edu-raspberry_pi-circuitpython/)

macOS Ventura has introduced a regression bug in copying UF2 files to microcontroller boards. At present, copying with Finder results in an “error code 100093”. In the Terminal, you can use cp -X at the moment. A number of maker companies are jointly reaching out to Apple to seek a fix. Raspberry Pi has stated they'll make a blog post about the issue and current status on November 1st. See details - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/31/uploading-uf2-files-with-macos-13-0-ventura-apple-microbit_edu-raspberry_pi-circuitpython/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there was one new board added:

- [ESP32-S3 Box Lite](https://circuitpython.org/board/espressif_esp32s3_box_lite/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20221101/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **387**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.4 on Sunday, October 30. This release fixes the ESP32-C3 builds, which weren't working at all, includes some additions to the Pi Pico W network support, and fixes a bunch of bugs, as usual.

Last week, I fix some sleep alarm problems, improved the documentation of hardware limitations in CircuitPython, and fixed one unusual Espressif board build. In the coming week I'll be working on more network and sleep problems. Some users may have also developed a workaround for the LC709203F problems on ESP32-S3, and I'll take a look at that.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Adafruit LTR-329 and LTR-303 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ltr-329-ltr-303). This guide has everything you need to get started with the LTR-329 and LTR-303 light sensor breakouts. They're nearly identical, except the LTR-303 has interrupt capabilities. If you picked up one of these boards, check out this guide!

Next I'm working on the PCF8575 guide. This is a 16 pin I/O expander breakout that uses I2C and includes STEMMA QT connectors. It's a fantastic little breakout if you need to add extra GPIO to your project. Keep an eye out for this guide!

I ended up coming down with COVID and was out sick most of this past week. I'm starting to get back into things as I get my stamina back. I did some work on the CLUE robot guide from my CircuitPython Day Livestream.

This week I extended a previously created dispalyio ListSelect widget to support showing a subsection of a list that is longer than the available space on the screen. I used this new functionality for selecting the category in the trivia game I am working on. I also soldered up a cow bell proto board and moved the circuit to it from a breadboard, and began modeling a case to put everything into.

Again, I've been working on Pico W. There were a number of small changes that improved reliability. And speaking of reliability, I was excited to accept a Pull Request from github user @georgboe to fix the error "MMQTTException:" with no explanation; georgboe had previously fixed exactly the same bug in the Pico W implementation.

While I don't recommend it (responding to any http server request takes about 8 seconds!), it will soon be possible to operate a secure HTTP server from a Pico W once the [related Pull Request](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/7122) is merged.

This week I worked on a [Flapping Halloween Vampire Bat project](https://learn.adafruit.com/flapping-halloween-vampire-bat). It uses a Circuit Playground Express and two servo motors. The onboard NeoPixels use the LED Animation library to display a comet animation and the servo motors move the attached 3D printed wings in a flapping motion. 

Next, I'm starting to look into using a Pico W for an HTTP server with CircuitPython. There are a lot of MicroPython examples, but I haven't really seen many in CircuitPython so I think that will be useful for folks.
