## JUST IN: Adafruit is a Company Sponsor of MicroPython on GitHub

[![Sponsorship](../assets/20220510/20220510heart.jpg)](https://github.com/sponsors/micropython)

MicroPython has been looking for sponsorship via GitHub for awhile and GitHub had only allowed individuals to do so. Recently GitHub changed their policy and has allowed company accounts to also sponsor projects. MicroPython's goal is US $5,000 per month. Adafruit has been sponsoring MicroPython via other mechanisms, to include stocking PyBoards in the Adafruit shop. Adafruit has announced they are now also sponsoring MicroPython via GitHub, allowing MicroPython to reach 93% towards their goal.

There are multiple tiers for sponsoring. If you benefit from MicroPython or CircuitPython (which is a MicroPython fork), please consider sponsoring MicroPython, helping them reach their goal - [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/micropython).

A more comprehensive blog post will be coming from Adafruit soon on their sponsorship. When it's out it'll be in this newsletter.

## The I2C Connection Standard Zoo

[![I2C Connection Standard Zoo](../assets/20220510/20220510i2c.jpg)](https://hackaday.com/2022/05/04/the-connector-zoo-i2c-ecosystems/)

When it comes to I2C-on-a-connector conventions, you would correctly guess that there’s more than one, and they all have their pros and cons. They consist of six-and-a-half standards! They’re mostly inter-compatible, and making use of them means that you can access some pretty powerful peripherals easily - [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2022/05/04/the-connector-zoo-i2c-ecosystems/) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/05/05/i2c-ecosystems-the-connector-zoo-hackaday/).

## RISC-V CEO seeks 'world domination' by winning over the likes of Intel

[![RISC-V](../assets/20220510/20220510intel.jpg)](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/07/riscv_ceo_seeks_world_domination/)

The CEO of RISC-V's governing body says she wants to nothing less than "world domination" for the rising open-source processor technology, but to do that, the nonprofit needs buy-in from a variety of organizations, even those steeped in dominant, proprietary architectures, such as x86 giant Intel.

RISC-V has more than [2,400 members](https://riscv.org/announcements/2021/12/risc-v-celebrates-incredible-year-of-growth-and-progress-ratifying-multiple-technical-specifications-launching-new-education-programs-and-accelerating-broad-industry-adoption/) to include companies, universities, and government-related entities - [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/07/riscv_ceo_seeks_world_domination/).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm writing a general CircuitPython "port test" library, which will test, as automatically as possible, whether the native modules, such as `digitalio`, `busio`, etc. are functioning properly. Some of this testing can be done with no wiring, but in some cases pins will need to be wired together, or connecte to external devices. The testing already found one minor issue in the Espressif implementation.

**Jeff**

While there was already a lot of coverage of PyCon on the internet and in this newsletter, I can't resist making another plug for [the blog entry I wrote](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/05/04/jeffs-experiences-at-pyconus2022-adafruit/) about my experience. tl;dr: It was great!

My recent work on the core has been of an investigative sort. I looked for possible improvements to our pseudorandom number generator (`random.randrange` and friends), but didn't end up finding any changes I thought were worth including. I have another Pull Request out to make a slight optimization of flash memory usage, but as we're a bit concerned about other impacts of the change it hasn't been merged yet.

I've been learning about Juypter Notebooks. It's a version of Python that runs in the browser with a slick interface called 'the notebook'. These look like a great way to allow someone to run complex Python code without installing anything locally, and in a self-documenting way, through free-tier services like Google Colab. I hope to provide a version of the flux visualization program that can run this way.

**Kattni**

I spent most of the last week at PyCon US 2022. I saw so many friends I haven't seen in 3 years, and overall it was an amazing experience. We hosted Open Spaces for two hours each of the three conference days, and the full two days of development Sprints. Both were well attended. The Open Spaces were an introduction to CircuitPython using the Circuit Playground Bluefruit. Everyone who attended was incredibly engaged, and many people told me they learned a lot. I was able to hand out the CPBs on Sunday after the Open Spaces were over, so some folks headed home with them. Two attendees designed projects with the CPB, and submitted them to my [PyCon2022 GitHub repo](https://github.com/kattni/PyCon2022), which was really exciting to see. The Sprints were an opportunity for folks to contribute to the CircuitPython project in a way that interested them, as well as facilitating folks who wanted to learn about CircuitPython. We had a number of issues closed by those who attended the Sprints. Some of the chosen issues turned out to be a bit hard-mode, but everyone stuck through it and persevered. They all felt that they accomplished something and learned new things in the process.

This past week, I continued helping out at PyCon US 2022. On Monday and Tuesday Kattni and I hosted the Development Sprints. We had a lot of fun and were able to meet a lot of great folks.

I reviewed PRs from and worked remotely with folks at the PyCon sprints. We had several people pick up some of our "good first issues". I made a snake game for the pygamer and pybadge and integrated it with the basic badger example so you can show off your name and info along with snake or whatever other project you want.

This past week I worked on two new product guides for the [VL53L4CX time of flight sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-vl53l4cx-time-of-flight-distance-sensor) and the [DVI breakout board](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dvi-breakout-board). The DVI breakout guide has a page that walks through using the PicoDVI examples by Luke Wren for the Raspberry Pi Pico which I think will be helpful for folks. I'm getting towards the end of the laser harp project. It is coded using CircuitPython for 8 VL53L4CD time of flight sensors so it will be an example for folks using multiple I2C devices that use the same address.
