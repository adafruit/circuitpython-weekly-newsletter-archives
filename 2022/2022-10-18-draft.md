## CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 2 Released!

[![CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 2 Released](../assets/20221018/20221018cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/13/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-2-released/)

CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.2 was released! It is relatively stable, but there will be further additions and fixes before final release - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/13/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-2-released/).

**Warning: The flash partitioning for the Raspberry Pi Pico W has changed since 8.0.0-beta.1. When you load 8.0.0-beta.2 over beta.1 (or vice versa), on the Pico W only, CIRCUITPY will be erased and reformatted.**

Notable changes to 8.0.0 since 7.3.0

* Added WiFi workflow with browser-based device discovery, filesystem browsing, upload, download, file editing, serial/REPL connection.
* Added a one-line status bar, which displays connection status, last exception, and version on a terminal window title or on the top line of an attached display. Support for status bar display is also being added to the Mu and Thonny editors.
* `.env` file in CIRCUITPY specifies WiFi connection parameters, BLE name, and other startup values.
* `dotenv` support: `os.getenv()` values are set by values in `.env` file. Values can be fetched from other `dotenv`-format files.
* WiFi functionality implemented on the Pi Pico W.
* Revised Espressif camera support, now available on ESP32, ESP32-S2, and ESP32-S3.
* Bulk analog input: `analogbufio` (available only on RP2040 for now).
* Pin state can be preserved during deep sleep (available only on Espressif for now).
* Allow setting USB VID, PID, manufacturer, and product ids at runtime.
* Enabled `collections.deque` on most builds.
* `MP3Decoder` and `WaveFile` can now take a filename instead of an open file.
* `AnalogIn` values are full range from 0 to 65535, instead of having zeros on low-order bits.
* In-place firmware update (`dualbank`) capability may be disabled in favor of a larger CIRCUITPY drive.
* Added `TileGrid.contains()`.
* Added `os.utime()`.

## Join the Python Developers Survey 2022: Share and learn about the community

[![Python Developers Survey 2022](../assets/20221018/20221018psf.jpg)](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/10/join-python-developers-survey-2022.html)

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is conducting the sixth iteration of the official Python Developers Survey. The goal is to capture the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year’s, they can identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community and the key insights into it. The PSF encourages you to contribute to our community’s knowledge. [The survey](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/10/join-python-developers-survey-2022.html) should only take about 10-15 minutes to complete.

The survey is organized in partnership between the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains. After the survey is over, the PSF will publish the aggregated results and randomly choose 20 winners (among those who complete the survey in its entirety), who will each receive a $100 Amazon Gift Card or a local equivalent - [PSF](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/10/join-python-developers-survey-2022.html).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.2 on October 13. It has much more complete Pico W WiFi support, courtesy Jeff, including SSL. There are also many other fixes and additions.

By upgrading to a newer version of the ESP-IDF, I was able to fix a couple of problems in the Espressif WiFi code, including a crash and a scanning problem. Unfortunately, this version does not yet fix the ESP32-S3 I2C problems we are seeing.

I am still chipping away at the remaining issues for the 8.0.0 final release.

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on updating the Running [TensorFlow Lite Object Recognition on the Raspberry Pi 4](https://learn.adafruit.com/running-tensorflow-lite-on-the-raspberry-pi-4) guide so that it can now be used with the latest Bullseye release. This involved a lot of trial and error to find what settings played nicest together.

**Tim**

This week I worked on implementing the Bitmap.blit() function for Blinka_DisplayIO. This function exists in the core but and existed but without an implementation in Blinka DisplayIO. Adding it to Blinka_DisplayIO brings the API in line with core displayio and allows BitmapLabel from the adafruit_display_text library to work correctly. I also worked on various tests of wifi functionality for the Pico W device and am making a few variations of a trivia game as a more complex example project for it.

**Jeff**

I worked on solidifying the support for WiFi on the Raspberry Pi Pico W, as well as on a number of smaller Pull Requests and issues. The newest beta added SSL support for the Pico W and fixed several problems with dotenv that came up in the context of internet projects. We continue to ask users to test the Pico W and submit feedback via GitHub issues or on Discord.

**Liz**

This past week I worked on a guide to import the [CLUE Custom Badge project into PyLeap](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyleap-clue-custom-conference-badge). Since folks will be using PyLeap for this project, I included instructions on editing the code with the File Glider app to customize the badge. This is a great way for folks to use and edit CircuitPython projects without a computer.

I also updated the [Arduino to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/arduino-to-circuitpython) guide. There was some guide feedback relating to updates that have occurred with CircuitPython over the last few releases so everything should be up to date now.
