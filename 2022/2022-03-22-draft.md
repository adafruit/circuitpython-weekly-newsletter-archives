Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! 

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Proposed Python Standard Library Deprications

[![Python Standard Library](../assets/20220322/20220322lib.jpg)](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/888043/66bf43728bb39692/)

Python has often been touted as a "batteries included" language because of its rich standard library that provides access to numerous utility modules and is distributed with the language itself. But those libraries need maintenance, provided by the Python core development team. Some of the modules are not being maintained any longer and they likely are not needed by most Python users. A long-running project to start the removal of those modules, [PEP594](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/), has recently been approved - [lwn.net](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/888043/66bf43728bb39692/).

## CircuitPython 7.2.3 Released

[![CircuitPython 7.2.3](../assets/20220315/20220315p7.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases)

CircuitPython 7.2.3, the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython, was released and it's the new stable release - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases).

**Notable fixes to 7.2.3 since 7.2.0**

* Espressif I2C pull-up detection fix.
* SAMD21 auto-reload reliability. In addition, for auto-reloads on any board, the program will stop more quickly, and will wait 0.75 seconds (was 0.5 seconds) after the last filesystem write before restarting.
* Update known certificates.
* Fix `countio` problems when used outside of code.py.
* Add `from __future__ import` annotations to allow program compatibility with CPython.
* Fix spurious `ReloadExceptions` when in the REPL.
* Improve auto-reload logic to avoid triggering multiple reloads, especially on RP2040 and macOS.
* Re-enable `_bleio` and remove frozen `PortalBase` on Adafruit MatrixPortal.

## False Advertizing Claiming Software is Open Source and When it is not?

[![Open Source](../assets/20220322/20220322osi.jpg)](https://opensource.org/node/1218)

The Open Source Initiative is claiming that a recent US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently affirmed a lower court decision concluding what we’ve always known: that it’s false advertising to claim that software is “open source” when it’s not licensed under an open source license. This would be huge news in the Open source ecosphere - [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/node/1218).

BUT, another article states the Open Source Initiative’s blog post on the Neo4j appeal is self-serving, misleading, and wrong.

> The court didn’t legally decide anything about the meaning of “open source”. It didn’t define any new terms of art legal-system-wide. It didn’t even make precedent. The first page of its decision says “NOT FOR PUBLICATION” at the top and “This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3” at the bottom - [/dev/lawyer](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2022/03/17/OSI-Neo4j-PureThink.html).

The legal precedents in the Open Source field apparently continue. In chosing Open Source products and software, it's best to look at the license provided for the materials and see if that fits your needs. Licenses like MIT provide much broader use than GNU or Creative Commons.

## Power Cycling a Whole Museum of Computers With Feather

[![Power cycling a whole museum](../assets/20220322/20220322eth.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/21/power-cycling-a-whole-museum-of-computers-with-feather-esp32-jeffersglass-hackaday/)

Flicking a circuit breaker to power cycle hundreds of desktop computers inside interactive museum exhibits is hardly ideal. Tasked with finding a solution, Jeff Glass mixed off-the-shelf UPS (uninterruptible power supply) hardware, an Adafruit [Ethernet FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3201) and CircuitPython on a [Feather ESP32-S2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5000) to get computers shut down and restarted properly - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/21/power-cycling-a-whole-museum-of-computers-with-feather-esp32-jeffersglass-hackaday/), [Jeff Glass](https://jeff.glass/post/quick-dirty-system-power/) and [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2022/03/18/power-cycling-museum-computers-on-the-cheap/).

## Raspberry Pi Users Urged to Change Default Passwords

[![Raspberry Pi Users Urged to Change Default Passwords](../assets/20220322/20220322raspi.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/18/raspberry-pi-users-urged-to-change-default-passwords-piday-raspberrypi-raspberry_pi/)

Security experts have called on Raspberry and Linux users to change default passwords on their machines as new data revealed the extent of bot-driven attempts to hijack systems. It found that 70% of web traffic was comprised of bot activity, with default credentials the most common passwords used by bad actors to attempt access. Of the top failed default credential login attempts targeting the honeypots, Linux username and password “nproc” was in second, and the combo of “pi” and “raspberry” came eighth - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/18/raspberry-pi-users-urged-to-change-default-passwords-piday-raspberrypi-raspberry_pi/) and [Infosecurity Magazine](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/raspberry-pi-users-change-password/).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

After releasing CircuitPython 7.2.1 on Monday of last week, we found another problem with auto-reload, released 7.2.2 on Tuesday, and then found yet another problem on Wednesday and released 7.2.3 the same day. There is one remaining problem but it is less pervasive. Our aim is not to make a new release every day, even if it keeps CircuitPython in the news (lol), but when we must, we do. We also need to thoroughly test a fix instead of just making sure it fixes the original problem. These particular bugs we fixed don't lend themselves to easy automated testing, but we should think about how to do that.

**Jeff**

Thanks to some recently-merged changes in fluxengine, reading and writing Apple ][ disks on a TEAC floppy drives and the Adafruit Floppy prototype board is working really well. I posted up a video showing me use a disk written this way on a real Apple //e. [Check it out on the Adafruit YouTube Channel!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU6eMyiT2TM&list=PLjF7R1fz_OOWexf2WmY8cgM65ltPaAvyT)

**Kattni**

This week, I've been working with Liz to get her spun up on creating new product guides. She's been picking everything up super quickly and is doing a fantastic job! She's already put at least two new guides into moderation. Next up is showing Liz how to do the guide updates for boards for which we've released a STEMMA QT revision. I'm sure she'll make quick work of this as well!

I started a personal-but-work-tangential project, porting a CircuitPython Timestamper written by Tim for MacroPad to the NeoKey FeatherWing. In doing so, I found a massive bug in CircuitPython 7.2.0 stable. That's since been fixed, and a new release made. Glad we figured it out quickly!

**Melissa**

This past week, I worked on a bunch of CircuitPython code including rewriting some Google Calendar examples for the MagTag and PyPortal so that it works on the latest version of CircuitPython. I also wrote some examples for using the new 1.47" and 1.9" TFT displays.

**Tim**

I hosted the CircuitPython weekly meeting for the second time this week. It's been great to be able to step in to the rotation of folks that host. I noticed that I've begun to start feeling more comfortable and natural while hosting. I went over the process for applying patches to most/all library repositories with Kattni and Eva. I also streamed the first Deep Dive w/ Tim episode this week filling in while Scott is away. On the show I worked on creating async based displayio examples.

**Scott**

This last week, I've been switching between working on the ESP32-S3 and fixing/improving autoreload on CircuitPython. On the ESP32-S3, I took a look at some sleep issues. One issue was fixed with an ESP IDF update and the other appears to be an existing IDF bug, so I'll file an issue for it. I then had an idea for a web workflow that uses MDNS to discover local CircuitPython devices. I'm currently adding MDNS support for testing out this idea. I'll soon be on paternity leave, so we'll see how far I get.

This was my first week full-time with Adafruit! I've been working with Kattni to learn how to write the new product Learn Guides. We started with the VL53L4CD STEMMA board. I've also been working on a video mixer with Processing on a Raspberry Pi, which will have hardware controls with Blinka.
