## The Raspberry Pi Turns 10 Years Old

[![Raspberry Pi Turns 10](../assets/20220301/20220301anniv.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiwm5TMHIy8)

Almost exactly ten years ago today, thousands of people set their alarms, and woke on leap-day morning to discover that the Raspberry Pi Foundation had started selling Raspberry Pi computers. By the time the all-volunteer team gathered in the pub that evening for celebratory drinks, licensees Farnell and RS Components had taken over 100,000 orders (despite struggling to keep their websites online under the load). Raspberry Pi was on the road to becoming a bit larger than they'd planned. See the ten year anniversary post on the Raspberry Pi Computer - [Raspberry Pi Blog](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/happy-birthday-to-us-3/).

And see this interesting video on the history of the Raspberry Pi, just released - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiwm5TMHIy8).

## CPython Bug Reporting Moving to GitHub

[![CPython Bug Reporting Moving to GitHub](../assets/20220301/20220301bug.jpg)](https://www.python.org/)

As part of a multiyear process, mainline Python (CPython) has slowly been moving its development infrastructure to GitHub. Now the bug tracking component is being migrated, led by Python's developer-in-residence, Łukasz Langa. bugs.python.org will be retired from active service (but live as a read only history) if the migration is successful.

> Langa noted that Python and GitHub were able to learn from the experience of the LLVM project, which migrated from Bugzilla to GitHub Issues back in December. That migration took 21 days, so the hope is that experience will lead to a smoother (and quicker) transition for Python (estimated to be 4 to 7 days).

The intent of of moves is geared toward attracting new developers who are familiar with and comfortable using GitHub.

## The PyCon US 2022 Schedule is Out

> Chris took inspiration from Dan Aldred for the Python code. It was fairly simple to link each MP3 recording to a specific phone number once the code dealing with the rotary dial was in place. The rotary dial connects to the Raspberry Pi via the GPIO pins. There’s one pin to manage the “pick up” switch, one to detect the start of dialling, and one that pulses according to the number you’re dialling.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there was one new board added:

- [Badger 2040](https://circuitpython.org/board/pimoroni_badger2040/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220301/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **346**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Last week the CircuitPython team went over the open issues for 7.2.0 and 7.x.x, and did some triage. As of last Thursday, the team has fixed all the remaining 7.2.0 issues, and we are on track for a 7.2.0-rc.0 release.

I did some type annotation infrastructure work, moving `circuitpython_typing` out of `adafruit-blinka` and into its own library. A few type-annotated libraries then needed their dependencies updated. This was partly prelude for my continuing work on an asyncio-enabled HTTP requests library.

**Jeff**

In CircuitPython, I fixed some small issues that resulted from updating with MicroPython 1.18.

In floppy land, I've been working on a short guide that will show how to modify a standard 5.25" PC floppy drive so that (together with software like fluxengine or greaseweazle) it can read the flip side of floppies written on classic 8-bit computers.

**Kattni**

Over the last week, I finished updating the VEML7700 guide with the STEMMA QT revision. I added I2C and TFT examples to the TFT Feather guide. I updated the BNO055 guide to not mention Feather M0 as the library no longer works on M0 boards. I updated some Arduino graphics test code for the TFT Feather, and I put together an Arduino template for boards with a built-in TFT. I'm currently working on CircuitPython and Arduino templates for reading data from the LC709203 battery monitor found on ESP32-S2 boards, as well as a template explaining how to send and receive data from Adafruit IO. Finally, I'll be finishing up the Feather TFT guide; it still needs a number of CircuitPython Essentials pages added. Keep an eye out for the updates!

**Tim**

This week I have done some tweaking in the Winamp skin conversion script, and Winamp player circuitpython code in order to make better use of the larger screen on the PyPortal Titano. The other improvement I'm working on will be allowing it to search for MP3 files automatically on the SDCard if the user has not provided a playlist.json file with their songs in it. The other thing I've got in the works is trying to update the certificates that CircuitPython uses when HTTPS requests are made in order to update the James Webb Telescope project to use a newer more direct data source API.

**Scott**

This week has been a bit short due to the Monday holiday. Last week I did a couple quick bug fixes for the 7.2.0 release and then kept working on USB Host support in CircuitPython.

I'm starting on the iMX RT 1060 because it has two USB peripherals. I've created a TinyUSB demo that uses both and converts HID to CDC. It is in a pull request [here](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb/pull/1340). This is a good step to get a feel for the TinyUSB API.

I also started brainstorming the CircuitPython API on [my stream last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOgwQSAiydM). This week I'll continue brainstorming and start to implement it now that I have the TinyUSB example going.
