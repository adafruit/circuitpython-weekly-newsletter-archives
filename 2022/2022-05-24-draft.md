## MicroPython Surpasses Original GitHub Sponsorship Target

[![MicroPython Surpasses GitHub Sponsorship Target](../assets/20220524/20220524sponsor.jpg)](https://github.com/sponsors/micropython)

MicroPython has been using [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/micropython) to raise funds for development. With over a hundred donors, they fell short of $5,000 a month. Adafruit has already been a sponsor since corporate sponsors were added, and they promoted this worthwhile effort to other MicroPython users. The effort recently surpassed the $5k mark and MicroPython has increased their target to $10,000 per month to hire an additional developer. Are you a user of MicroPython or CircuitPython (a MicroPython derivitive)? Please consider sponsoring some money per month - [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/micropython).

## Project of the Week: Using Two Displays in CircuitPython

[![Two Displays](../assets/20220524/20220524eyes.gif)](https://twitter.com/todbot/status/1526664851459743746)

Multiple Displays in CircuitPython and Compiling Custom CircuitPython - [todbot.com](https://todbot.com/blog/2022/05/19/multiple-displays-in-circuitpython-compiling-custom-circuitpython/).

> Did you know you can run multiple displays in CircuitPython? One way: wire up two displays in parallel. There’s also true dual displays. Only a single display is supported for the pre-built versions of CircuitPython (The one exception is the MonsterMask) Multiple displays are supported in the design of CircuitPython, but it’s a compile-time setting. This is for RAM savings reasons.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.3.0 release candidate builds 7.3.0-rc.0 and 7.3.0-rc.1, and perhaps by the time you read this CircuitPython 7.3.0 final will be out.

One bug I worked on for 7.3.0-rc.1 prevented allocating large blocks of RAM after significant imports. I thought it was going to be complicated to debug, but it turned out we had stopped doing automatic garbage collection we did after each import. The code had simply gotten lost during the MicroPython v1.18 merge.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Library File Types and Frozen Libraries page](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/library-file-types-and-frozen-libraries) in the Welcome to CircuitPython guide Advanced Setup section. We are regularly getting a similar set of questions regarding the different library file types, what they mean, which one should be used, how to get past common issues, and more. This page has everything you need to know about .mpy files, .py files, and frozen libraries. If you've ever wondered how CircuitPython interacts with the different library types, check out the new guide page.

I also added a new section to the CircuitPython Libraries page in the Welcome guide titled [The Adafruit Learn Guide Project Bundle](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/circuitpython-libraries#the-adafruit-learn-guide-project-bundle-3118462-5) which explains the general idea behind the Project Bundler, how the downloaded zip is structured, and how to use it. It's linked in the Library File Types page where I explain how frozen libraries work with the Project Bundle.

Finally, I spent some time working with Tekktrik to teach him how to use Adabot. The next step will be to have him try to run an actual patch. We'll find out soon how it goes!

This past week, I finished writing the [2.7" eInk Breakouts and Shields guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-7-eink-display-breakouts-and-shields). I have also been going through the guide feedback on a number of guides that I had made major contributions to, but were under other peoples' names.

I completed a few remaining tweaks and much more thorough testing for my core PR to allow vectorio shapes to be hidden when their containing Group gets hidden. That was merged this week after testing and reviews were completed. I wrapped up some requested changes to some of the typing PRs opened during PyCon sprints and followed up with the author on the one that remains open. I also made some updates to Blinka_DisplayIO to add some of the newest functionality that was added to core displayio recently, accessing tile size properties on TileGrid, and updating the Bitmap object for a TileGrid. Lastly I tested and reviewed a PR to add a more advanced TabLayout example created by community member Paulsk.

This week I wrapped up switching the NTP library over to doing NTP over native sockets. Then I worked on adding `dotenv` support to CircuitPython as an alternative to secrets.py. `.env` files are simpler, pseudo-standard format for storing secrets. It has two main advantages: 1) it can work in CPython and 2) CircuitPython can easily load the file when the Python VM isn't running. Its first use will be storing WiFi credentials so CircuitPython can connect automatically, even when the VM isn't running.

This week I published the Wireless LED Maracas guide (https://learn.adafruit.com/wireless-led-maracas). It was a great project to follow-up the more complicated Laser Harp build. This coming week I'll be working on a wearable/conference badge using the tiny traffic light model that just came into the shop. I'll be using a QT Py ESP32-S2 with CircuitPython so that it can use light sleep to preserve battery life. I'll also be doing some more Fritzing work with Kattni's guidance. I really enjoy making Fritzing objects. They have a very similar vibe to working on a word puzzle.

In my down time, I've been playing with some Eurorack synth and CircuitPython projects. Most recently, I've been prototyping a sequencer that sends out 1V/oct. I've been referencing Thea Flower's "Designing Winterbloom's Big Honking Button" (https://blog.thea.codes/designing-big-honking-button/) blog post for the different circuits needed to communicate with Eurorack for gate in, gate out and 1V/oct. On the  CircuitPython side of things, the gates can be handled as digital inputs/outputs and I've had a lot of luck using the MCP4728 STEMMA board for 1V/oct.
