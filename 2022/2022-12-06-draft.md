Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Last week we had some significant Python on Hardware milestones. This week, one more with one hundred single board computers (SBC) compatible with Adafruit's Blinka. RISC-V is showing up in more microcontrollers (like the ESP line) and SBCs. We look to feature significant RISC-V content to keep you informed as the industry progresses. Lots of great projects again this week with some holiday themed. We hope you're having a great December. - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## 100 CircuitPython Blinka Compatible Single Board Computers!

[![100 CircuitPython Blinka Compatible Single Board Computers](../assets/20221206/20221206blinka100.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/11/29/celebrating-100-single-board-computers-that-support-circuitpython-blinka-blinka-circuitpython-sbc-adafruit/)

CircuitPython is a programming language designed to simplify experimenting and learning to code on low-cost microcontroller boards.

Blinka brings CircuitPython APIs and libraries to single board computers (SBCs) like Raspberry Pi. Blinka is a pip installable Python library that runs in normal "desktop" Python (the CircuitPython runtime isn’t used). CircuitPython libraries can also be installed via pip.

Interested? See the [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux) on how to use Blinka with supported SBCs (like [Raspberry Pi](https://circuitpython.org/blinka?q=raspberry+pi), [Beagle](https://circuitpython.org/blinka?q=beagle) and more) - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/11/29/celebrating-100-single-board-computers-that-support-circuitpython-blinka-blinka-circuitpython-sbc-adafruit/).

## Building A Virtual Machine inside ChatGPT

[![Building A Virtual Machine inside ChatGPT](../assets/20221206/20221206vm.jpg)](https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/)

A new ChatGPT assistant was made recently made by OpenAI. It has the capability to solving IQ tests, tackling leetcode problems or to helping people write LateX. It is an amazing resource for people to retrieve all kinds of information and solve tedious tasks, like copy-writing! Frederic Besse has managed to do something different, running a whole virtual machine inside of ChatGPT.

Pytorch is on version 1.12.1 in this alt-universe. Pytorch version 1.12.1 was released on the 5th of August 2022 in our universe. That is remarkable, as ChatGPT was only trained with data collected up to September 2021. So this virtual machine is clearly located in an alt-universe - [Engraved Blog](https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/).

A Hanukkah Persistence of Light Lightsaber.

> "Toward the Jewish month Kislev, the month of light, I built Hanukkah Lightsaber prop based on a makers project of the Adafruit company. Beside building the hardware, I made the necessary adjustments for the Hanukkah holiday. 30 colored RGB NeoPixel LEDs are connected to Adafruit's Circuit Playground board, responsible for processing a BMP image, divide it into columns, and when deflected the lightsaber and expose to a camera with a slow exposure (today every cell phone have this feature), you get an image floating in space without the person deflecting the Lightsaber. Happy holiday full of light to everyone." - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/ClUeZeDN7Y1/).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I continuing to fix more bugs for the CircuitPython 8.0.0 release. I fixed a SAMD51 that caused buzzing noises when playing mono files as stereo. I'm also reviewing other folk's PR's and investigating bug reports. I expect to make another 8.0.0 beta release soon, but this will probably not be the last beta release, as there are still over two dozen issues to address before the final release.

**Kattni**

This week I started on a quick guide that is an Introduction to the Mastodon API, including CircuitPython examples of reading from (tracking a hashtag), and writing to (posting a toot) Mastodon. It covers the steps you need to follow to get an API token, which is necessary for both examples. If you're interested in dipping your toes into the Mastodon API, keep an eye out for this guide!

**Melissa**

This past week I continued working on rewriting the USB workflow on [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org/). It's coming along, but the closer I keep getting, the more bugs I keep discovering. Some of it is edge cases that most users wouldn't do, but as I try out new things I uncover the issues.

I also helped with getting some more boards added to Blinka and we are now up to over 100 boards. A lot of the work is thanks to all of the community members that have helped contribute to the project. I believe that with the Raspberry Pi shortages, many users have turned to alternative boards and out of necessity have added support to Blinka for those boards.

**Tim**

I have continued working on 2 efforts in the core. First displayio API changes, I've been restoring backwards compatibility for one behavior that lost it, and addressing other feedback from review. Second, the PixelMap class that has had parts of it moved into the core for added efficiency.

Work from community member Mark Gamblor has been incorporated to implement the getter function for slices inside the core. The core changes were merged this week, the python library that uses was also published this week. In the coming week I'll finish a few more changes and address any issues reported or revealed by additional testing.

**Jeff**

I've been working on some issues blocking the 8.0.0 release. It's mostly been smaller stuff, but it did include fixing a long-standing problem with the `sdioio` module on the Grand Central M4. I also made some small improvements to name resolution on Espressif microcontrollers, and reviewed PRs.

**Scott**

This week web workflow support on Pico W was merged in! It should be in the next beta. I also fixed deep sleep on the ESP32-S3. Next I'm refining a couple APIs (audiobufio and coproc) that were added when I was out on paternity leave. 

**Liz**

This week I worked on a guide for the [5x5 NeoPixel Grid BFF](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-5x5-neopixel-grid-bff). The grid configuration of NeoPixels is just enough to make some interesting projects. I'm excited to see what folks do with it.

I also wrote code for a getting started with the Mastodon API and CircuitPython. You can use the CircuitPython requests library to access the Mastodon API. I'll be working on this guide with Kattni and we'll include examples on sending a post via the REPL and following a hashtag.
