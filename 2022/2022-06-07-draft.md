Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! The week blew by with a US holiday at the start but there are lots of things happening: Python takes center stage this issue with several items, especially the results of the last Python Developer's Survey. Projects galore including many macropad and keyboard implementations. Enjoy this issue!

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## The Latest Python Developers Survey Results Are Out

[![Python Developers Survey Results](../assets/20220607/20220607survey.jpg)](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/06/python-developers-survey-2021-python-is.html)

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) announced the results of their fifth official annual Python Developers Survey. The work is done each year as a collaborative effort between the PSF and JetBrains. Late last year, more than 23,000 Python developers and enthusiasts from almost 200 countries/regions participated in the survey to reveal the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it.

Python is being used by the vast majority (84%) of survey respondents as their primary language and by many others as just one more tool in their box - [PSF Blog](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/06/python-developers-survey-2021-python-is.html) and [survey results summary](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2021/).

## Python 3.11 is up to 10-60% faster than Python 3.10

[![Python 3.11](../assets/20220607/20220607new.jpg)](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/welcome-python-3-11-an-upgrade-to-counter-decades-long-speed-issue/)

Python 3.11.0 has reached beta 1 status and is close to release. It is up to 10-60% faster than Python 3.10. On average, developers measured a 1.25x speedup on the standard benchmark suite. How is this being done? Python 3.11 is the first release to benefit from a project called Faster CPython, where CPython is the standard version of the interpreter. Faster CPython is a project funded by Microsoft, whose members include Python inventor Guido van Rossum - [Analytics Insight](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/welcome-python-3-11-an-upgrade-to-counter-decades-long-speed-issue/).

## Google's Plan to Make Chip Development More Like Open Source Software

[![Make Chip Development More Like Open Source Software](../assets/20220607/20220607google.jpg)](url)

The Google Hardware Toolchains team is launching a new developer portal, developers.google.com/silicon, to help the developer community get started with its Open MPW shuttle program. This will allow anyone to submit open source integrated circuit designs to get manufactured **at no-cost** - [Google Open Source Blog](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/05/Build%20Open%20Silicon%20with%20Google.html) via [Slashdot](https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/22/06/04/2356258/googles-plan-to-make-chip-development-more-like-open-source-software).

## Make: Boards Guide Review: Adafruit Feather RP2040

[![Make: Reviews the Adafruit Feather RP2040](../assets/20220607/20220607make.jpg)](https://makezine.com/products/boards/adafruit-feather-rp2040/)

The Make Boards Guide reviews the Adafruit Feather RP2040 - [Makezine](https://makezine.com/products/boards/adafruit-feather-rp2040/).

> One of the most exciting things about the RP2040 is the number of programming environments to which it is amenable. Raspberry Pi’s own Pico SDK enables development in C, C++ or assembly, while Earle Philhower’s Arduino-Pico core brings unofficial Arduino support to the board. But because this is an Adafruit board, we thought it would make the most sense to try it with CircuitPython, the MicroPython fork that Adafruit recommends as the best way for newcomers to the world of microcontrollers to get started. <br> &nbsp; <br>If you would like to use CircuitPython with the Feather, the first thing you’ll need to do is flash it with the required firmware, which is a relatively simple process. This is thanks to the RP2040’s in-ROM USB UF2 bootloader, combined with Adafruit’s dedicated firmware download site: just save the .uf2 file to your PC, hold the BOOTSEL button while plugging in your board via USB, and drag the file to the “RPI-RP2” mass storage device that appears. The board will recognize the presence of this new firmware, flash and reset itself, and you will be presented with a newly-named drive “CIRCUITPY” into which you can start dropping CircuitPython code.

## This Week's Python Streams

## Project of the Week: Programming CircuitPython with Windows XP

[![Programming CircuitPython with Windows XP](../assets/20220607/20220607win.jpg)](https://twitter.com/IShJR/status/1532874905338974210)

David took up a quest posited by your editor on whether old versions of Windows could be used to program CircuitPython boards - [Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/IShJR/status/1532874905338974210).

> And to once and for all answer the question that I know has been dominating everyone's thoughts since [@anne_engineer's Crowd Supply steam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf1SJ5o7F0M), YES you can develop for the Adafruit Feather RP2040 on pocket-sized Windows XP devices!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Kattni**

This past week has been starting a few things at once to accommodate one ending up on hold for reasons. I'm close to finished with the QT Py ESP32 Pico, but need the hardware to complete it. The QT Py will be here tomorrow. 

I worked on getting GIFs of double-pressing reset on various CircuitPython boards to get into the bootloader for adding to the WipperSnapper app. Getting the rhythm right is one of the biggest support issues with anything involving putting boards into the bootloader, and WipperSnapper relies on this. We're hoping that the addition of the GIFs will help alleviate that.

Next up is a guide on fancifying your GitHub profile. There are a number of tools that can get you through using Markdown to add all sorts of information to your profile in simple and more involved ways. This guide will cover some of the available options and link to many more.

**Melissa**

This past week I did some work on the [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/) website. First I added a bunch of additional checks that are performed on new [Pull Requests](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-org/pulls) that will check things such as the image dimensions and that required fields have values that make sense. I also went through and fixed issues that were caught with these checks on the current boards. This should make reviewing any new boards much easier.

The other thing I did was to add issue labels to the [open issues under the contributing section](https://circuitpython.org/contributing/open-issues) of the website. This will make it easier to see all open issues related to CircuitPython at a glance.

**Tim**

This week I worked on making the PWM frequency used for the display backlight be an argument that can be set when the display is initialized inside the core. This allows for the PyPortal Titano and any devices using its same display driver chip to have better more accurate control over the backlight, especially at lower brightnesses. The argument is working successfully on the Titano, the last thing to do is update all boards with built-in displays to pass the default value to the new argument during display initialization. 

I'm also working on my core PR to add a `contains` method to TileGrid class so it can be touch interactive, I will complete some minor requested changes for that PR and look into making a similar API for Group object as well.

**Scott**

This week I've been wrapping up my work to optimize the [translation code size](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/6440). It trades compile time for code size.

I've also been playing around with changing the CircuitPython's terminal to have a status bar. The status bar would allow us to show all of the different statuses: wifi, ble, usb and usb host. The status bar work is part of the larger web workflow goal which would auto-connect to wifi, advertise with mdns and present a REST API for editing CircuitPython files.

**Liz**

I've been working on some IoT projects this past week. First, I redid the [OpenWeatherMap PyPortal demo project](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-weather-station) to be in portrait mode and to turn the display off and on with the PyPortal's light sensor. It involved rescaling the bitmaps and changing up the coordinates of the text elements. This is for a collaboration project with the Ruiz brothers that will be coming out in a few weeks.

The other IoT adventure I've been on has been using CircuitPython with Microsoft Azure. I'm using the Feather ESP32-S2 TFT with a BME688 sensor. On the TFT screen, I have the temperature, humidity, pressure and battery life data displayed. Every 15 minutes the data is sent up to Microsoft Azure and the TFT shows the timestamp. This learn guide will be out soon and will go through how to setup everything on the Azure side as well.
I'm going to be off next week, but when I return there are some fun music tech/synth projects in the pipeline.

## Upcoming events!
