## Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit is Out of Beta

[![Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit](../assets/20220208/20220208pi64.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-os-64-bit/)

Over the past year, Raspberry Pi has been trialling a beta of Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit. Last week it finally came out of beta. - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-os-64-bit/).

> "The ARMv8-A architecture, which encompasses the 64-bit AArch64 architecture and associated A64 instruction set, was first introduced into the Raspberry Pi line with Raspberry Pi 3 in 2016. From that point on, it has been possible to run a full 64-bit operating system on our flagship products, and many third-party operating systems are available. However, we have continued to build our Raspberry Pi OS releases on the 32-bit Raspbian platform, aiming to maximise compatibility between devices and to avoid customer confusion. <br> <br>there are reasons to choose a 64-bit operating system over a 32-bit one. Compatibility is a key concern: many closed-source applications are only available for arm64, and open-source ones aren’t fully optimised for the armhf port. Beyond that there are some performance benefits intrinsic to the A64 instruction set: today, these are most visible in benchmarks, but the assumption is that these will feed through into real-world application performance in the future.<br> <br>A more theoretical concern is that 32-bit pointers only allow you to address 4GB of memory. On Raspberry Pi 4, we use the ARM Large Physical Address Extension (LPAE) to access up to 8GB of memory, subject to the constraint that any process is limited to accessing 3GB. Some use cases will benefit from being able to allocate the entire memory of an 8GB Raspberry Pi 4 from a single process.

## A CircuitPython Pull Request to Add Split Screen Capabilities

[![Split Screen](../assets/20220208/20220208split.gif)](https://twitter.com/CycleMatch/status/1488370312492326918?s=20&t=n-MDQEFS8XHUjtxEpAiVxQ)

[![Split Screen](../assets/20220208/20220208split.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/5954#issuecomment-1028431918)

kmatch98 has a new PR in (#5954) that exposes the CircuitPython REPL's display group elements, allowing relocation of the REPL and making thinks like split screens possible without breaking the existing displayio structure - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CycleMatch/status/1488370312492326918?s=20&t=n-MDQEFS8XHUjtxEpAiVxQ) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/5954).

## Piku: a small command line utility for managing CircuitPython projects

Piku is small command line utility for managing CircuitPython projects. With Pikuyou can make creating a CircuitPython project, installing packages, deploying, and connecting to a CircuitPython device easy to do from the command line - [Adafruit Forums](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=188036), [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/piku/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/mraleson/piku).

> I am sure there are other tools out there but I tried to pattern piku after other package management tools i had used like poetry and npm. The tool makes it easier to create a project, add modules from the official and community bundles, deploy the project to the device, and connect to the device's serial port. I hope that in the future it will have similar functionality to other similar tools like poetry and npm. I have tested it lightly and it seems to work on Ubuntu and Windows and it may work on macOS (I don't have one to test on).<br> <br>Piku can be installed using pip. I only have a few devices to test on, but it has really helped me iterate faster on my personal project. I hope it is helpful to someone else who likes a command like workflow like me. I would also love help improving it if anyone feels so inclined. You can check the docs on pypi or github. Feedback welcome.

## Upgrade your CircuitPython Version on the Raspberry Pi Pico Without Access to the BOOTSEL Button

[![Upgrade your CircuitPython Version on the Raspberry Pi Pico](../assets/20220208/20220208cheese.jpg)](https://www.robmiles.com/journal/2022/1/27/upgrade-your-circuit-python-version-in-the-raspberry-pi-pico)

Upgrade your CircuitPython version on a Raspberry Pi Pico without access to the BOOTSEL Button - [Rob Miles](https://www.robmiles.com/journal/2022/1/27/upgrade-your-circuit-python-version-in-the-raspberry-pi-pico).

> You can use a couple of Python statements to get your Pico to reboot into firmware mode so that you can drop in a new version of CircuitPython (or anything else). You can issue the commands down the terminal connection. I used the Thonny program which provides a REPL connection to my CircuitPython powered CheeseBox (or Crackers Controller).<br>
 <br> <code>microcontroller.on_next_reset(microcontroller.RunMode.UF2)</code><br> <br> This is the first command you type in. It tells your device to reset into UF2 mode next time it is reset. <br> <br><code>microcontroller.reset()</code><br> <br>This is the second command. It resets the device and makes it appear as as storage device into which you can load the firmware.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I fixed some Espressif I2C issues last week, and also fixed a problem that caused SAMD builds to crash immediately.

We wanted to be able to host free versions of "a certain word game" on CircuitPython boards, and discovered there was no simple HTTP web server written for ESP32-S2 boards. I found an initial version someone had created and rewrote it to be more general. The code will be a library and will be shown in a guide soon.

I am researching how to provide async versions of HTTP clients and servers. There is a nice library, `aiohttp`, used with CPython, but it is large and comprehensive. I am looking at some other smaller libraries, such as `asks` and `httpx`, and will see whether we can created a limited `adafruit_` version of one of these, as we did with `adafruit_requests`.

**Jeff**

While my main work continues to be on floppy drives, I've put in a few pull requests to CircuitPython as well.  One will update the "SDK" we use for RP2040 boards to the current version, and another starts to add "mdns" support to the espressif port.  This latter feature will allow you to use a hostname to connect to an espressif device (e.g., *qtpy.local*) instead of an IP address. Hopefully this will dovetail with some work that Dan has been doing to create a CircuitPython web server.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Arcade QT guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-led-arcade-button-qt). This board has been out for a bit, but other things took priority over the guide. Folks have been asking for examples, so I put together the guide this week. It has everything you need to get started with your Arcade QT board. Check it out!

**Melissa**

This past week I made some really good progress on porting LittleFS to JavaScript. I found a [nice online C compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler) that really helped out because I could paste snippets of code to test along with the appropriate includes and test the output of code as easily as I could test JavaScript making comparing some of the low level functions very easy. It turns out there were a few functions that were returning different results than I expected and once I got the same outputs for the same input, I was able to get the rest of the code working very well. I now have it outputting a very similar file to what I was expecting and just have a little more debugging to do.

**Scott**

This week I hit my first bump on the BLE on ESP journey. The NimBLE stack that the ESP-IDF uses relies on defining all of the services to serve up front. On nRF and in our API, we're able to add services after the stack has started. This works well for CircuitPython where the user code can add more Services as needed. Thankfully, NimBLE is open source and we can modify it to handle adding Services later.

I'll start on that work after I test and propose the other changes I made this week. They lay out much of the code needed to talk to services served by the other device. This is known as the client role. It will allow CircuitPython to connect to other devices and read the data that they make available. Doing the work in stages is a best practice because it 1) minimizes how much code is on one person's version of CircuitPython and 2) allows others to use and test the newer code.
