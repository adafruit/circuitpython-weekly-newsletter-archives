## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were six new boards added!

- [M5Stack ATOM Lite ESP32 IoT](https://circuitpython.org/board/m5stack_atom_lite/)
- [M5Stack Core Fire](https://circuitpython.org/board/m5stack_core_fire/)
- [M5Stack Stamp C3](https://circuitpython.org/board/m5stack_stamp_c3/)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20221108/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **389**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Kattni**

This week I mostly worked on the PiCowbell Proto guide. This guide will include four different ways to assemble the PiCowbell with a Pico, including images of the entire process to ensure you have success when assembling yours. There will also be a pinouts page, and examples of detecting a STEMMA QT sensor plugged into the PiCowbell using CircuitPython and Arduino. If you picked up one of these handy boards, keep an eye out for this guide for details!

I also worked with Alec on prototyping a setup to obtain the CircuitPython Library PyPI download stats. A few years ago, PyPI stopped providing that data directly, as the number of packages had reached a point that providing that data was untenable for them. We considered trying to do it ourselves at that point, but nothing came of it. Last week, I brought it up to Alec, who jumped on it, and had an initial setup going the following day. So! The plan is to include the entire list of libraries in a new auto-generated file in the Adafruit CircuitPython Bundle, and the top ten PyPI downloaded libraries in both the CircuitPython Weekly Meetings and this newsletter. We're working on getting it implemented now and it might be included as soon as this newsletter! If not, keep an eye out for it soon.

**Melissa**

This past week, I finished up writing the [Bluetooth CLUE Robot Car using CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluetooth-clue-robot-car-using-circuitpython) guide from my CircuitPython Day Livestream. This uses a CLUE board and a Ring:Bit Car Kit for a great introduction to robotics using CircuitPython.

I also update the [Using Google Assistant on the BrainCraft HAT or Voice Bonnet](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-google-assistant-on-the-braincraft-hat) guide. Google had deprecated authenticating production projects, so making it test project fixed that issue. The software packages had also been updated and a key package had breaking changes and was no longer being maintained. I was able to fork the repo and fix the issues.

**Tim**

In the past week I made a pass through all eligible hacktoberfest PRs to label and review them. I made UI enhancements to the Pico W Trivia game and began modeled a 3D printable case for it. The first real print will be a test plate to ensure all mounting features are located properly.

**Jeff**

Another month, another keyboard! This week I published a guide on the Adafruit Learning System showing how to hook up a vintage IBM PC keyboard to a modern PC using CircuitPython. You can [check the guide out now](https://learn.adafruit.com/ibm-pc-keyboard-to-usb-hid-with-circuitpython).

**Liz**

This past week I worked on a [CircuitPython HTTP server with the Pico W](https://learn.adafruit.com/pico-w-http-server-with-circuitpython). It was a lot of fun to work on and a great learning experience. It shows folks how to pass the HTML code with CSS styling as an f string so that variables from code.py can be included, such as sensor data. There are also buttons on the HTML site that can turn the onboard LED on and off and turn on the party parrot animation on the OLED screen (my favorite displayio trick/test). These buttons work by sending HTTP POST requests. I hope this will be a good example for folks that want to try out setting up an HTTP server.

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20221108/20221108weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
