## What is a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)?

[![What is a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)?](../assets/20221129/20221129rtos.jpg)](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/projects/what-is-a-realtime-operating-system-rtos/28d8087f53844decafa5000d89608016)

A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system (OS, often a lightweight OS) that runs multi-threaded applications and can meet real-time deadlines. Some microcontrollers use RTOS behind the scenes to run code and to do things like radio. Shawn Hymel explains all the details in this article and video - [maker.io](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/projects/what-is-a-realtime-operating-system-rtos/28d8087f53844decafa5000d89608016) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/F321087yYy4).

## Open Source & Saying "No"

[![Open Source & Saying "No"](../assets/20221129/20221129no.jpg)](https://connortumbleson.com/2022/11/28/open-source-saying-no/)

From an Open Source maintainer, it's extremely important to say "no" to requests/features that bloat a library too much. Many times it is played out is something like this:

* Talented contributor Z delivers feature X to project Y.
* Project Y accepts it.
* Feature X has an issue in latest release.
* Project Y didn't start that feature so asks contributor Z for some help.
* Contributor Z is not around and the fix is taken in by the project.

So a project shouldn't think about the short term benefit of a new feature, but understand the long term implication of supporting such feature - [Connor Tumbleson](https://connortumbleson.com/2022/11/28/open-source-saying-no/).

## Raspberry Pi Pico: Now Also Made in Kenya

## Seeing Python on Hardware Content on Mastodon

[![Mastodon](../assets/20221129/20221129mastodon.jpg)](https://nerdschalk.com/how-to-follow-a-hashtag-on-mastodon/)

*Ed:* It was pleasant today typing #circuitpython in the Mastodon search box and seeing posts from a multitude of servers plus a follow icon so I could subscribe to that hashtag. If you are on Mastodon, here is a list of hashtags you may wish to follow:

* #MicroPython
* #CircuitPython
* #RaspberryPi
* #Python (although this could be a large number of posts as it is very general)
* #PythonOnHardware

We're promoting the latter as encompasing using any flavor of Python on hardware. Using multiple tags would be best. An article from this week: How to follow a hashtag on Mastodon - [Nerds Chalk](https://nerdschalk.com/how-to-follow-a-hashtag-on-mastodon/).

Here are the official accounts you may want to follow. Content may not be as copious as the hashtags as they are very new:

* @circuitpython@fosstodon.org
* @micropython@fosstodon.org

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added, but several are in process.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm checking and fixing yet more issues for the CircuitPython 8.0.0 release. I haven't been able to replicate the some of the problems described in the last few issues I took on. But in the process of testing, I've found related bugs or problems, so  I've been fixing those instead :).

**Kattni**

This week I worked with Liz on some projects we're working on together. She wrote and collaborated on the code for my next project, the Holiday Countdown Timer using the quad alphanumeric backpacks with STEMMA QT. This no-solder project will include a 3D printed case. It's a short week this week, so I'll be starting on that next week.

**Melissa**

This past week I got back to working on [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org) and fixed some bugs. I’m currently working on updating the USB workflow with an API function that allows you to select a folder and perform file operations similar to the Web Workflow.

**Tim**

This week I've been working on displayio API changes in the core and integrating the usage of a new core PixelMap class that makes animations more effecient.

**Scott**

This week I've been diving into web workflow on Pico W. I got web workflow going and then moved onto getting the MDNS portion working. MDNS allows CP devices to respond to circuitpython.local and cpy-MAC.local. I got it working before Thanksgiving break and will propose a pull request for it next week.

**Liz**

I wrote a guide for the [NeoPixel Driver BFF](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-driver-bff). The board allows you to easily drive a strip a NeoPixels with a QT Py or Xiao form factor board. Up next, I'll be working on a guide for the 5x5 NeoPixel Grid BFF. That board has a 5x5 grid of NeoPixels that attaches to a QT Py or Xiao board. I'm excited to see how folks use it.

I've been working with Kattni on some upcoming project code. I've been using the Mastodon API with CircuitPython on a Pico W to send and receive data from Mastodon. I also wrote code to use three daisy chained alphanumeric displays as a scrolling countdown clock.
