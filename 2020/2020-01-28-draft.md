## Announcing Mu version 1.0.3

[![Mu](../assets/01282020/12820mu.jpg)](https://madewith.mu/mu/releases/2020/01/26/mu-1-0-3.html)

[The latest stable version of Mu is here](https://madewith.mu/mu/releases/2020/01/26/mu-1-0-3.html)! 

>_"Version 1.0.3 is a bug-fix release with no new features. We didn’t intend to cut this release but changes in the way the latest OSX works meant that code highlighting didn’t work correctly. We also managed to apply a fix to an annoying bug relating to where Mu set the current working directory for scripts run in Python3 mode. OSX Catalina has posed a number of problems, from the incorrect rendering mentioned above, to the way the application should be installed and problems with permissions when flashing a BBC micro:bit. The simple answer to the installation story is, once you’ve installed Mu in your Applications folder, you should first open it with CTRL-click (not a double click) and select the “Open” button in the resulting pop-up. Subsequent runs of Mu can be started in the usual “double click” way. If you don’t do the “CTRL-click” trick you’ll see a pop-up complaining about Mu not being checked for malicious software."_

If you find Mu useful or would like to support the goals of this project, you might want to think about sponsoring the creator and lead maintainer [Nicholas Tollervey](http://ntoll.org/article/sponsorship).

## Sponsor Nicholas Tollervey on GitHub Sponsors

[![ntoll](../assets/01282020/12820ntoll01.jpg)](https://github.com/sponsors/ntoll)

[Nicholas Tollervey](https://twitter.com/ntoll) ([ntoll](https://github.com/ntoll)) is now [sponsorable on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/ntoll), so for all the times folks out there said “I really want to support ntoll’s work!” here is your chance, if you've ever downloaded [Mu](https://madewith.mu/), [please sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/ntoll), we did –

>_"I develop software that helps folks learn the skills and knowledge they need to imagine, develop and program the stuff they want. In addition to writing software, I spend a lot of time researching and thinking about how folks learn, use and create with code. Examples of my work include the [Mu code editor](https://codewith.mu/) (aimed at beginner programmers and educators), various MicroPython related tools for easily working with embedded / microcontroller based systems, and [PyperCard](https://pypercard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (a simple cross platform GUI toolkit for beginners, based upon HyperCard concepts and written in Python). These are exercises in digital emancipation, exploration and education. I value simplicity, compassion, openness, collaboration and fun."_

## CircuitPython in HackSpace Magazine: Serpente 10 out of 10, and more...

[![Serpente](../assets/01282020/12820serpentehs.jpg)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/27)

[Issue 27 of HackSpace Magazine](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/27) features the Serpente, a tiny but powerful microcontroller board capable of [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/). 

HackSpace rated the Serpente board 10/10, saying the Serpente is “So small and runs Python.” 

You can find Serpente boards on [tindie.com](https://www.tindie.com/products/arturo182/serpente-a-tiny-circuitpython-prototyping-board/).

## Winners of the Take Flight with Feather contest!

[![Take Flight](../assets/01282020/12820takeflight01.jpg)](https://hackaday.com/2020/01/22/winners-of-the-take-flight-with-feather-contest/)

Thank you Digi-Key, Hackaday, Hackaday.io, Supplyframe, and all the folks who entered the contest! Here are the [winners of the Take Flight With Feather Contest at Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2020/01/22/winners-of-the-take-flight-with-feather-contest/)!

## [The Open Book Feather - An open hardware reading device](https://hackaday.io/project/168761-the-open-book-feather)

> It’s hard to beat the fidelity and durability of printed text on paper. But the e-paper display gets pretty close, and if you couple it will great design and dependable features, you might just prefer an e-reader over a bookshelf full of paperbacks. What if the deal is sweetened by making it Open Hardware? The [Open Book Project](https://hackaday.io/project/168761-the-open-book-feather) rises to that challenge and has just been named the winner of the [Take Flight with Feather contest](https://hackaday.io/contest/168107-take-flight-with-feather). This e-reader will now find its way into the wild, with a small manufacturing run to be put into stock by Digi-Key who sponsored this contest. Let’s take a closer look at the Open Book, as well as the five other top entries. You may remember seeing the Open Book [back in October](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/31/building-an-open-hardware-ebook-reader/) when Tom Nardi looked in on early testing for the board. It was prototyped using the Adafruit Feather, which of course was the main requirement of the contest. The controller is now built into the board for standalone functionality with the Feather header providing an opportunity for expansion. The screen is 4.2″ with a resolution of 300×400\. It reads files from a microSD card and uses seven buttons on the front of the board for user input. A dedicated flash chip stores language files with the character sets of your choice. The small LiPo cell can be charged via the USB port, and of course e-paper helps greatly in reducing the power consumption of the reader. You’ll find a few extras on the back. There’s a headphone jack for listening to audio books, and get this, a built-in microphone and a TensorFlow-trained model allow for voice control! There are STEMMA headers to add your own hardware options, and designs for laser-cut and 3D-printed enclosures.

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/01282020/12820blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **208**!

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

[![Bryan](../assets/01282020/12820bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Earlier this week I wrote the guides for the LIS3MDL 3-axis magnetometer and the LSM6DS33 6-DoF Gyro & Accelerometer combo. These guides will accompany the new breakouts for those sensors, including one with both!  

I later did some refactoring of the ICM20649 library to allow its sensors (gyro, temp, accelerometer) to be accessed and read individually. This will allow for single sensors to be passed into code that can do fun stuff with sensor fusion. I will be continuing on and doing a similar refactor on other libraries.  

After the ICM20649 refactor I added tester code so that it can be put into production. This one was interesting as it allows for an external I2C bus for talking to other sensors. To test it I hooked up a sensor I had handy to the external I2C bus and then put the sensor into a mode that allows the main I2C slave bus to bypass the internal I2C master hardware and connect it to the external bus. I was then able to verify that I could find the sensor I had connected.  

Lastly by the time you read this we'll be just about done with the migration of the CircuitPython libraries to GitHub Actions. It's been a bit of a slog, but it's to be expected when you're maintaining repositories for over 200 libraries! This will be a good long term move as it's also made us reconsider how we want to maintain the libraries going forward. More to come on that front.

CircuitPyton 5.0.0-beta.4 is [now available](https://circuitpython.org/downloads): I made a new release on Tuesday evening. This release fixes some regressions that were in beta 3, and includes BLE bonding. BLE HID with bonding is now working! Check out the latest [BLE HID projects](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/01/22/new-guides-ble-volume-knob-hid-keyboard-buttons/) for more details. You'll need to use the [latest 5.x library bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) with 5.0.0-beta.4 and those projects.  

We're finishing off the remaining 5.0.0 issues so we can get 5.0.0 final out to you. So there will more upcoming beta and release-candidate releases -- as many as needed to make sure we have things working well before the final release. As always, it's done when it's done!

After diving deep into low level audio code for the past few weeks, I took a different direction in the last few days and started implementing icon-based navigation for JEplayer.  

The interaction with the icon bar itself is pretty solid, but some of the functions weren't clear for my first alpha tester.  So I expect to re-work this a bit based on feedback.  [The code is pushed](https://github.com/jepler/JEplayer) and the pull request and issue trackers are open, if this interests you and (pre-)alpha quality code doesn't scare you away.

Over the last week, I published the [ItsyBitsy nRF52840](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-itsybitsy-nrf52840-express) guide. It includes everything you need to know about the ItsyBitsy nRF, including an overview, pinouts and more. I completed multiple Fritzing objects to get us caught up with having Fritzings for all the new boards and breakouts we've recently added to the store. I updated the Circuit Playground library to include a friendly `NotImplementedError` in the Express module when attempting to use features not available for the Circuit Playground Express, which involved another stack size increase in CircuitPython for CPX. I added a page to the CircuitPython Made Easy on Circuit Playground Express and Bluefruit guide called [The Technical Side](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-made-easy-on-circuit-playground-express/the-technical-side) that explains how the Circuit Playground library works behind the scenes. If you've ever used the Circuit Playground library, you know it simplifies using any of the features of the Circuit Playground boards, but you may not know how it does so. This page is an in depth explanation of how the library works under the hood from import to use, and covers why it works a little differently on Circuit Playground Express. If you're interested in understanding the underlying concepts, check it out. Currently, I've started the guide for the MLX90640 Thermal Camera which will cover details about the breakout and examples for how to use it. If you are looking to get started with your new MLX90640, keep an eye out for this new guide.  

We've begun planning for PyCon 2020. This will be an ongoing thing between now and the conference. There's a ton to do and we're getting a head start this year. I will be presenting a tutorial on CircuitPython and Circuit Playground Bluefruit for the conference this year. Some of the Adafruit team will be attending, and, like last year, we'll be hosting Open Spaces and Sprints. If you're planning to attend, consider joining the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord), dropping in to the #pycon-us-2020 channel, and letting us know. I'm really looking forward to it!

This past week, I worked on updating the HT16K33 LED Backpack guide and updating the CircuitPython HT16K33 driver by adding a lot of features that were missing when compared to the MicroPython port. I also back-ported some features from the FeatherWing library such as marquee scrolling and matrix shifting that I had worked on last year so that non-featherwing displays could use them. You can check out the [guide here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-led-backpack).  

There were a lot of Pull Requests for Blinka and related libraries from community members that I spent some time reviewing and testing the code. It's awesome to see this project growing and community members contributing.  

I also worked with John Park to help write a demo to display the current song playing on the phone onto the TFT Gizmo using the Apple Media Service and Bluetooth. This was adapted from the example included with the Apple Media Service library that displayed the information in the REPL.  

**Scott**  

The end of last week I was heads down on the early iMX RT port to CircuitPython. I've gotten a pull request out for it that includes Teensy 4.0 support. It should be merged soon!  

I got a bit behind on email and everything else so this week was getting caught up. Now that I'm caught up, I've been wrapping up the CircuitPython BLE library for the Apple Media Service which John Park will be using shortly. I've sorted out some library maintenance things for it with Dylan and Brian's help which will make adding more BLE libraries easier.  

Currently, I'm tweaking PixelBuf to simplify it's API a bit before 5.0.0 is official. Folks will be very excited for the NeoPixel speedups it brings.
