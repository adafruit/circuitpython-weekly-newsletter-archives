## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

The past week has been pretty productive! I’ve added a few more report types to the BNO080 library as well as the regular refactoring. Things are coming along well and it won’t be too long until I can start thinking about putting a bow on it. This is pretty exciting because I think it’s going to be a very popular sensor because it does a good job at making it easer for the user to get useful information from it, thanks to its inbuilt fusion sensor algorithms. 

The most notable part of working on the BNO080 library this week is discovering that when you have multiple sensor or motion classifier reports enabled, by default all of the available reports will be batched together into one packet and sent back together. This escaped my notice until now because the reports are simply concatenated without any additional “packaging”, so I was always able to parse the first report which gave me just enough data to make it seem like everything was working fine.

[![Bryan](../assets/20200908/20200908bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The big news in CAN land (or at least my corner of it) is that I’m now successfully sending CAN frames using the MCP2515 in CircuitPython, and they can be read and unpacked by the other devices on the bus! This is just the very first steps to getting something usable, however. There is still plenty of work to be done to bring this library up to the standard set by the existing Arduino libraries, in addition to whatever pythonification (it’s a word, look it up) is needed to make it fit within the CircuitPython ecosystem.

Later this week I’ll be working with Jeff/Jepler on sketching out the API that CAN devices of all sorts will use within CircuitPython. While I’m working with the MCP2515, he’s hard at work adding support for the CAN peripheral within the SAM-E51. Once we both get the basics of bytes flowing back and forth working, we’ll start planning a “minimum viable product” which is project manager speak for “an initial working example with no bells and a single whistle” with an implied “bell expansion pack coming soon!”

**Dan**

[![Dan](../assets/20200908/20200908dan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

My initial \_bleio HCI pull request has now been revised, approved, and is merged. I've touched up the adafruit_ble library to add the ability to specify an HCI adapter. After discussion with Scott, I created a separate adafruit_airlift library to handle HCI-adapter-specific initialization, instead of embedding it in the standard adafruit_ble library.

I released CircuitPython 6.0.0-alpha.3 late last week. I reviewed Scott's pull request to add native ESP32 support for WiFi; it should be merged soon. So we'll have another release with two big new pieces of functionality shortly. The new release will probably be beta.0, since we've finished up the API changes and additions we had in mind for CircuitPython 6.0.0.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20200908/20200908jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

What sounds like it should be simple, but turned out to take about a half week to resolve?  A couple of bugs that were reported with RGB matrices.  Once this Pull Request is merged, it will fix some bugs that community members and Adafruit folks reported.  Before the fixes, these bugs would lead to Safe Mode or crashes requiring use of the reset button.

- When RGBMatrix needs more RAM than was available, CircuitPython will now raise a MemoryError
- A display small enough that it can't even show a 1x1 terminal will work properly
- RGBMatrix Displays can now be rotated, in case you want an extra tall display, like this 64x32 matrix in portrait orientation

**Kattni**

This week I've been working with stepper motors. We have had Arduino examples for using the DRV8833 and TB6621 stepper motor driver breakouts, but no CircuitPython. Now we have both! I added a new page to both guides with wiring diagrams, library install instructions, and a full code example. If you've looking to use these drivers with CircuitPython, check out the guides to get stepping!

I also created and worked on the FeatherWing 128x64 OLED guide. It's a new Wing we released recently with double the display of the previous OLED FeatherWing. There's no CircuitPython support currently, but it is in the works. For information on pinouts, assembly, and resource downloads, check out the guide once it's published.

**Lucian**

This week I worked on debugging a display related crash for the ESP32, along with some other buried issues related to the ESP32 stack. It was a good opportunity to get GDB up and running with Espressif's software packages, which is a somewhat non-trivial process - debuggers like the Jlink aren't natively supported, and it takes some fiddling around with FreeRTOS settings to get the debugger to connect. Now that it's fully enabled, it'll be easier to visualize tough bugs, and track down stack corruption more systematically. 

I also worked on adding STM32 F103 family support this week. It's not fully complete yet, but I've added flash and filesystem support, which was a tricky hurdle for newer developers to the port, and solved some of the issues holding up USB.

**Melissa**

This past week was quite productive. I started out by writing the Adafruit_Python_Shell library to make converting shell scripts over to Python easier to do and maintain. I updated a couple of scripts that I had convert to use the library and they shrank to nearly 50% or their previous size.

After that I updated the MatrixPortal library and made some improvements such as adding a Middle Graphics layer so setting the background was much easier. I also exposed the network and graphics objects so I didn't need to keep adding functions in 2 places every time I added something new. I added some Adafruit IO functions to the library and updated the Adafruit IO library for CircuitPython so that all the data can be grabbed instead of just the first and last values.The reason I was adding that functionality is because I was working on a demo for John Park's workshop so we can use Adafruit IO to grab data and display it on the Matrix.

While I was working on that functionality, I decided to add a requested feature so that the ESP32SPI Wifi can now use multiple access points which can be handy if you're moving between locations. It will cycle between the different sets and is backwards compatible.

[![Melissa](../assets/20200908/20200908melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The other project I worked on was the STM32MP1 so that we can get Blinka running on it. I had put in some time a few weeks ago, but ended up putting it on hold when I couldn't get Pip running on it. After that, I was just working on it a little at time as I had some free time. I found there was a newer image than the one that came with it and so after some experimentation, I figured out how to update it using the STM32MP1 to flash the SD card. The method I found to work was not such a straightforward method, especially since the software STM32CubeProgrammer would crash on MacOS.

It turns out that there's a Command line interface core hidden inside that can be run from the terminal to write the new image. With the new image, I tried once again to get pip installed and this time I was successful. Once I knew I had a good image, I used ApplePiBaker to backup a copy and verified the image could be written just using BalenaEtcher, so we now have a much easier way to update on all systems.

This week I've been focused on the Requests library. I made a lot of changes to add support for HTTP 1.1, lower memory when loading JSON, and the newer wifi API introduced with the ESP32S2's native wifi. Unfortunately, I wasn't very confident that I wouldn't break existing uses.

So, I decided to write a few unit tests that verify that the requests logic works both with the new features and the old legacy API. Testing is a great way to build confidence in functionality. By running the tests every code change you also ensure that the functionality continues to work.

I've created the PR for review and will be testing it with existing projects. If (who am I kidding), when, I find bugs then I'll add additional tests to detect the bug and then fix it.

On my stream today I plan on going over my requests changes and then doing a round of iteration on my native_wifi PR based on Dan's feedback.
