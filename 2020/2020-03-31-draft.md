## HackSpace Magazine Issue 29

[![HackSpace Magazine Issue 29](../assets/03312020/03312020hs.jpg)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/29)

The new HackSpace Magazine Issue 29 presents making a frogger-like game in CircuitPython. An Adafruit Circuit Playground Express is used as a tilt-sensor controller.

> The tribute to this game in the new Code the Classics Volume 1 book is called Infinite Bunner, and works in much the same way, except you control a bunny. All this hopping got us thinking about a controller. Our initial idea was that since the animals jump, so should the controller. The accelerometer can detect freefall, so it shouldn’t be too hard to convert those into button presses. However, it turns out that computer-controlled frogs and rabbits can jump much, much faster than humans can, and we really struggled to get a working game mechanic, so we compromised a little and worked with ‘flicks’.

## Made with Mu

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep an eye out here for updated download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

The team is still working hard on updates! What's happening:

**Bryan**

This week I finished up the DS1841 libraries for CircuitPython and Arduino including support for manually setting the wiper, editing and using the LUT, and enabling or disabling the temperature compensation feature. Now that we will have a log potentiometer, I hope to see more people using these handy little I2C helpers to give them programatic control over parts of their circuit.

Next up I'm starting the long process of migrating all of our Arduino library repositories on GitHub over to using GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Having a solid CI system is invaluable for making sure that tedious things like checking formatting and documentation are still up to snuff without relying on humans to remember to check regularly. For folks with _many_ repositories and _many_ contributors, a good CI system is basically required. 

GitHub Actions is particularly useful because it's well integrated with GitHub, which many folks use for hosting their projects. We have a _lot_ of repositories, so having a common framework for CI and project hosting is going to help keep things in check.

In the Bluetooth Low Energy device-of-the-week world, I'm now working on CircuitPython BLE drivers to connect to a couple of different low-cost pulse oximeters. I am reliably getting data from one, and am working on the other.

I had a breakthrough on the SAMD51 spurious flash writes problem with the help of community members, and am now testing a fix. It appears we just need to set the brownout voltage detection to higher than the factory preset value.

**Jeff**

With my big projects, there's not much to show this week. The RGB matrix code with Protomatter is slowly improving, but more work is needed to make it behave 100% like a SPI or I2C display, and to make sure we lay the best groundwork for future framebuffer-bsaed displays.

But the little things matter too! A pull request merged this week will improve the error message when assigning to properties that are read-only. Formerly, the error would state "'SPI' object has no property 'frequency'", but in a future release of CircuitPython it will say "'SPI' object cannot assign property 'frequency'", giving a better experience when troubleshooting your code.

**Kattni**

This week we've all had our lives turned a bit upside down. Remember you're not alone in this, and the Adafruit community is here to support you. Reach out to us on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord) for any reason. There are thousands of people in the same situation, all continuing to gather together to support each other through this. Remember to share your projects and ideas, and continue to help others navigate this uncertain situation. We are strongest together.

I worked on updating a couple of guides with new revisions of the boards: the [APDS9960 proximity, color, light and gesture sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-apds9960-breakout) and the [VL6180 time of flight sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-vl6180x-time-of-flight-micro-lidar-distance-sensor-breakout). We added STEMMA connectors to both boards, and I updated the guides with updated photos, wiring diagrams, schematics and pinouts. The guides now have everything needed to get started with your new STEMMA compatible breakouts.

We've also begun the process of applying to [certify](https://certification.oshwa.org/) some of our Adafruit hardware as Open Source with the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://www.oshwa.org/). We're starting with our [CircuitPython compatible microcontroller boards](https://www.adafruit.com/category/956). Dylan has gathered the necessary info and started submitting the applications. We'll keep you posted on the progress. We're looking forward to being a part of the growing [list of OSHWA certified Open Source projects](https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html)!

**Lucian**

This past two weeks I've been working on transitioning the STM32 Port over to the H7 and F7. This has been a two parter - on the one hand I've been adding new functionality to support the Cortex M7 and new peripheral types featured on these chips, but on the other I've been revisiting and fixing old and inflexible code that wasn't built to handle chips outside of the STM32F4 series. One recent addition has been Python scripts to auto-generate peripheral code for the different variations of STM32 SoCs, as well as a revamp of how packages are managed in the Microcontroller module. 

While I have my first version compiled and running on the H743 Nucleo, I'm still testing to make sure that the new changes do not break F4 builds like the Feather or Discovery boards. I've also been keeping tabs on other STM32 work that's been done by others recently, such as the new NVM module for flash memory, and the low power work being done by Scott via the RTC module. 

Outside of Circuitpython, I've been in touch with some open-source colleagues who are working on projects that they hope will combat the spread of COVID19. I'm hoping I'll have more updates about that soon. 

**Melissa**

This week I finished up a Follow-up guide for adding new Single Board Computers to Blinka. Where as the first guide was about adding detection code so that Blinka knew which board it was working with, this guide was the real meat about actually adding your board to Blinka. You can check out the guide at https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-blinka.

I also worked on re-skinning the Web Bluetooth Dashboard that I worked on a few weeks ago to make it match the Adafruit website much better. This was more than just changing some colors and adding a logo, but required working on developing some new panels so that it looked much better for the user.

**Scott**

Up to the start of this week I was continuing my work on sleep. I wrapped up STM32 and then iMX RT when surprisingly quickly. So, sleep is getting close and will need thorough testing. The PR will be out of draft once two dependent PRs are merged in.

While I wait for those PRs, I've swapped to BLE MIDI. I've got MIDI coming out of CircuitPython and am working on getting MIDI in going. It's been quick so far and should wrap up soon. There are a few fixes to CircuitPython core that will be needed for it. I'm excited to hack an nRF52840 into some of these old 80s era piano keyboards I have to give them midi in and out. :-)

Once BLE MIDI is done, I'll circle back to sleep and get that code checked in as well. Exciting times!
