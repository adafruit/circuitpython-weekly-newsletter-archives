What a great milestone for the open-source hardware, and CircuitPython communities, when something is open, it's shared, improved, built upon, and most of all - people use it together.

[What is the Open Hardware Summit?](https://2020.oshwa.org/)

>_"The Open Hardware Summit is the annual conference organized by the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://www.oshwa.org/) a 501(c)(3) not for profit charity. It is the world’s first comprehensive conference on open hardware; a venue and community in which we discuss and draw attention to the rapidly growing Open Source Hardware movement."_

[![Snekboard](../assets/01212020/12120snek.gif)](https://www.crowdsupply.com/keith-packard/snekboard)

[Snekboard - An open-hardware python microcontroller for LEGO](https://www.crowdsupply.com/keith-packard/snekboard), now on Crowd Supply, go back it!

>"_Learn, Teach, Experiment, and Play with Robots Snekboard is an open hardware development board that’s designed to let you hook up to LEGO Power Functions* motors and switches so you can build robots out of LEGO and control them with CircuitPython or the simpler Snek programming language. Snekboard is 48 x 48 mm – the same size as 6 x 6 LEGO studs – so you can easily build a LEGO enclosure for the board and attach it to your creation. It is powered by a 3.7 V, 900 mAh single-cell Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery that fits under the board and charges over USB while Snekboard is being programmed from the host."_

## Open Source Spacecraft - Software for Space powered by CircuitPython

[![Open Source Space](../assets/01212020/12120osspace01.png)](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-source-spacecraft-software-for-space-registration-85671256033)

The first meetup, hosted at Loft Orbital in SF will feature a presentation on an open-source Python cubesat framework by Max and KickSat-2 project by Zac from Stanford's Robotic Exploration Lab.  

[![Open Source Space](../assets/01212020/12120pycubed.jpg)](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-source-spacecraft-software-for-space-registration-85671256033)

The hardware and software pitfalls associated with satellite development greatly contribute to the nearly 60% failure rates of initial CubeSat missions. As the role of small satellites in commercial and scientific endeavors evolves beyond an “engineering exercise,” basic aspects of the spacecraft design must be matured and made widely available in order to continue advancing this valuable technology for Space exploration.  

[![Open Source Space](../assets/01212020/12120pycubed.gif)](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-source-spacecraft-software-for-space-registration-85671256033)

PyCubed: an open-source, radiation-tested CubeSat framework that cost-effectively integrates ADCS, TT&C, C&DH, and EPS into a single PC104-compatible module programmable entirely in Python. PyRCubed addresses many hardware-related failure modes of CubeSats through component and system-level radiation testing, in-depth design and qualification documentation, and on-orbit flight performance from an ongoing LEO mission (KickSat-2). The challenge of mission-ready software development is also mitigated through low-level implementation of the Python programming language via CircuitPython.  

[Project website](https://pycubed.org/), [Rexlab](https://rexlab.stanford.edu/projects/pycubed.html), [KickSat](https://kicksat.github.io/), and [KickSat-2](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/kicksat), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maholli404/status/1218279117100965890), and [event page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-source-spacecraft-software-for-space-registration-85671256033).

Starting awesome-stemma! This is the start of a new curated list of awesome Stemma connector resources including Stemma-equipped microcontrollers and breakout boards. Adafruit Stemma is a collection of solderless digital/analog/power/I2C connection standards based on JST PH 3 and 4 pin connectors. For smaller footprint breakout boards, the JST SH 4 pin connector may be used for I2C connections. Stemma equipped boards may be compatible with Seed Studio Grove connectors, SparkFun Qwiic connectors or DFRobot Gravity connectors. Cross-compatibility should be checked before interconnecting Stemma/Stemma QT boards with other manufacturer boards, as there could be connector incompatibilities or voltage issues (with Qwiic boards) - [github.com/adafruit/awesome-stemma](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-stemma/).

Python history, the ABC Programming Language ... [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)):

>_"[ABC](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/abc/) is an imperative general-purpose programming language and programming environment developed at CWI, Netherlands by Leo Geurts, Lambert Meertens, and Steven Pemberton. It is interactive, structured, high-level, and intended to be used instead of BASIC, Pascal, or AWK. It is not meant to be a systems-programming language but is intended for teaching or prototyping. The language had a major influence on the design of the Python programming language; Guido van Rossum, who developed Python, previously worked for several years on the ABC system in the mid 1980s."_

Good interview that is archived too - [The A-Z of Programming Languages](https://web.archive.org/web/20081229095320/http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id%3B66665771).

It's interesting that ABC was intended for teaching or prototyping, Guido did electronics as a hobby, developed Python later, and CircuitPython is REALLY good for teaching and prototyping. Full circle, [here's an interview from 2014](https://medium.com/dropbox-makers/guido-van-rossum-on-finding-his-way-e018e8b5f6b1) -

> **You were an electronics hobbyist before becoming a programmer. How did you get started in electronics?** Okay, we're going waaaay back. I don't know exactly why I got into electronics as a kid. I remember that from the last grade in elementary school and probably through my second year in university, electronics kits and my own designs were one of my big passions. It wasn't always an easy path. In elementary school, I took one of the first projects I built into class as a show and tell project. There was no one who understood what it was or why it was interesting or cared. It's a very vague memory. I just know that I took it in, and it fell flat.

We've tried to cover some historic Python, and Python on hardware efforts too, [tinypy (2008)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/04/python-on-hardware-history-tinypy/), and [PyMite (2009)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/03/python-on-hardware-history-pymite-python/).

## Team updates!

What is the team up to this week? Let's find out!

**Bryan**  

This past week has seen us close in on the end of the actions migration project. All of the libraries have been ported over and now it's just a matter of releasing all of the libraries. It'll take a while so hold tight!  

In driver news I did a refactor of the library formerly known as Adafruit_CircuitPython_LSM6DOX to add support for the LSM6DS33 that is on the new 9-DoF combo board, and in doing so did a refactor to pull common code into a LSM6DS class, renaming the library in the process. I just now finished the accompanying LIS3MDL CircuitPython library, so now the new 9-DOF board has full CircuitPython support.  

Finally, late last week I wrote my CircuitPython 2020 post with my thoughts, hopes and aspirations for CircuitPython in the coming year. I'm very exited for things to come, and I'm very hopeful that like previous years 2020 will be a banner year for CircuitPython.

**Dan**  

I finished up the implementation of BLE bonding; it will be merged into CircuitPython shortly. Now you can pair a CircuitPython device just once, and have it reconnect automatically after that. I've tested bonding with a BLE HID keyboard test program on iOS, MacOS, Windows 10, and Linux, and it's working well.  

I wrote a #CircuitPython2020 post, reviewing my #CircuitPython2019 post goals and adding some new thoughts.  

Now that bonding is finally done, I can go on and fix some remaining CircuitPython 5.0.0 issues so we can move toward a final release relatively soon.  

In the longer run, I would like to revamp timekeeping inside CircuitPython, so we can do low-power sleep. I also received positive reactions to thoughts about asynchronous programming and multitasking in my #CircuitPython2020, and would like to start revisiting that again.  

**Kattni**  

Over the last week, I worked on finishing up a few things associated with the Circuit Playground library update. I attempted to add friendly error handling to the Express module in the event that you try to import Bluefruit-only features, and ran into the stack size being too small again. This update will require increasing the stack size again, and therefore has been put on hold for now. I updated the [README](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CircuitPlayground/blob/master/README.rst) to include the install requirements for using the library on Express and Bluefruit, and the usage example to use the new import. In the near future, I will add a section explaining how the library works from a technical perspective - if you're interested in understanding what's going on under the hood, be on the lookout for that update. I created [four new Fritzing objects](https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library/tree/master/parts). Next up is the guide for the Itsy Bitsy nRF52840, so keep an eye out for that soon.  

I also completed my [CircuitPython 2020 post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/01/15/2019-highlights-and-a-pledge-for-2020-from-kattni-circuitpython2020-adafruit-circuitpython-kattni/). Thank you to everyone involved in CircuitPython. You make it what it is. I'm looking forward to another amazing year!

**Lucian**  

I spent this past week working on fixing a number of bugs for the next release, including some old busio issues with SPI and I2C, and a lot of stylistic cleanup that made things more consistent between old and new code. I also worked with Scott on resolving an issue with the UF2 bootloader on the upcoming Meowbit board, which should go a long way toward making UF2 possible on all of the STM32 boards.  

This week I'm hoping to (finally) wrap up the final DisplayIO related issues with the Meowbit and get it out the door. Following that, I'll be circling around to the Espruino and Discovery boards on my list, and hopefully back to new feature implementation on the STM32 port.   

**Melissa**  

This past week I have been working on adding lots of additions to Blinka, our CircuitPython library compatibility layer for Raspberry Pi and other Single Board Computers. One of the things that came out of that is I was able to get the Pine64 Board fully working with GPIO, I2C, SPI, and UART. In fact, it's working so well, that I will likely be writing a guide for it soon.

The other component that I've been working on is continuing on the HT16K33 library and guide updates. This is the library that controls the backpacks and FeatherWings including Segmented LED displays, the 8x8 and 8x16 matrix displays, and the bicolor bar graph. You can check out the [LED Backpack guide here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-led-backpack). For the library itself, I have been porting over some functions from other libraries such as a marquee function for the Segmented Displays and a shift function to animate much easier on the LED Matrix displays.

## Upcoming events!

[![PyCascades](../assets/01212020/12120pyc.jpg)](https://2020.pycascades.com/)

Scott is speaking at [PyCascades](https://2020.pycascades.com/) about Python's Next Decade and Us. It's February 8th and 9th, 2020.

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/01212020/12120helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
