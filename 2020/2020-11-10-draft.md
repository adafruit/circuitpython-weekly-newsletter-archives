## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

As expected, I was able to test the hardware for the TMP117 temperature sensor last week, and it went very well! I finished the CircuitPython library over the last week, and in the process I found a new favorite temp sensor! The data layout is quite easy to use, and the feature set works quite well for simple temperature related tasks. I'll be using this little gem in a few upcoming personal projects.

Additionally after bodgeing one little bug, I was able to verify the hardware for the new revision of the CAN FeatherWing, which uses the MCP25625 controller with the integrated transciever. Since this chip allows for a further shrinking of the required space, I think it's quite likely you'll see this chip in other, smaller forms in the future.

**Dan**

I fixed a final issue in the CircuitPython 6.0.0 release candidate build, and also merged in a few last minute changes from Lady Ada and Jeff Epler. On Monday night, I released the second release candidate, 6.0.0-rc.1. Please [try it out](https://circuitpython.org/boards) if you get a chance. If there are no further urgent fixes, we'll re-release rc.1 as the final 6.0.0 build. Yay!

I have finished up the BLE work I've been doing for the past several months, and I'm now going to join the folks working on ESP32-S2 CircuitPython port.

**Jeff**

A CircuitPython library isn't complete without a guide, so the past few days I've been working on a guide that intoduces canio and shows some simple programs to use it.  What will you do once you can network your CircuitPython boards together with canio?

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Adafruit Metro ESP32-S2 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-esp32-s2. It's full of all the details about the board including an Overview, Pinouts, and resource Downloads page. The guide also covers how to get started using the board with CircuitPython and how to get CircuitPython installed. If you managed to get your hands on one of the beta boards, check out this guide to get it up and running!

I also updated the pin definition for the Metro ESP32-S2 in CircuitPython as the initial pin def did not match. We decided to go with IOx pin names to avoid confusion due to the pin layout on the Metro ESP32-S2 differing from typical Metros. There is a page in the guide that clarifies the reasoning, and has a detailed diagram showing what pin names are available. If you want to use CircuitPython with this Metro and have the accurate pin definition, make sure you're running the absolute latest from the S3 link on CircuitPython.org. 

**Lucian**

This past week I worked on wrapping up my NeoPixel work, fixing some issues that only occur when multiple NeoPixel lines are used simultaneously, as well as making sure those fixes were added to the CircuitPython implementation as well. I also reviewed some incoming modules submitted by the community for the ESP32-S2, including CountIO and RotaryIO.

Beyond the NeoPixels, I've been brushing up on the UDP-IP stack so I can assist more with the networking end of the ESP32-S2 work - it's been a long time since I did network programming so I've been catching up on material I've forgotten. I'll hopefully have some working tests this week, so I can better assist with incoming issues related to network bugs.

**Melissa**

This past week I added the Voice Bonnet to the Google Assistant guide that I wrote. This was originally written for the BrainCraft, but fortunately it worked without modification for the Voice Bonnet just fine. You can check out [the guide here] (https://learn.adafruit.com/using-google-assistant-on-the-braincraft-hat).

I also worked with Scott to try and narrow down some of the issues with the latest version of the CircuitPython Requests library. I was able to fix a few of the issues and Scott is handling some of the intermittent connection issues.

Finally, I worked on a guide for the 1.5-inch 128x128 Grayscale OLED. The guide is coming along nicely and should be out very soon. Be sure to watch out for it.

**Scott**

This week I've been debugging the latest version of requests. I've found issues with both ESP32SPI co-processor sockets and the socket implementation in the ESP32-S2. It seems to be more resilient now *and* those two implementations better match how sockets work in CPython. As a result, it'll be easier to develop network libraries in CPython and expect them to work with both an ESP32 coprocessor (aka ESP32SPI) or the native networking on the ESP32-S2.

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
