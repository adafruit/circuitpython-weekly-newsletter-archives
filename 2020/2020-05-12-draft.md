## Teensy 4.1 Microcontroller Board Released

pjrc.com has opened up sales for the new Teensy 4.1 development board. 

[![Teensy 4.1](../assets/20200512/20200512teensy1.jpg)](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html)

[![Teensy 4.1](../assets/20200512/20200512teensy2.jpg)](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html)

[![Teensy 4.1](../assets/20200512/20200512teensy3.jpg)](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html)

It features improvements over the Teensy 4.0 board to include additional pins, a micro SD slot, and a 10/100 Mbit Ethernet 6 pin interface. Teensy 4.1 includes a USB host port broken out to a five-pin through-hole header on the inside of the PCB, as was done on the 3.5/3.6 versions - [pjrc.com](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html) and [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2020/05/11/new-teensy-4-1-arrives-with-100-mbps-ethernet-high-speed-usb-8-mb-flash/).

As the board is similar to the Teensy 4.0, which has a current port of CircuitPython, work has begun to port CircuitPython to Teensy 4.1 by Scott Shawcroft.

## Microsoft Heart Python

[![Microsoft Python for Beginners](../assets/20200512/20200512mspython.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6)

Microsoft Developer presents a series of 44 free YouTube videos entitled Python for Beginners - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6).

> Probably the largest hurdle when learning any new programming language is simply knowing where to get started. This is why we, Chris and Susan, decided to create this series about Python for Beginners! Even though we won’t cover everything there is to know about Python in the course, we want to make sure we give you the foundation on programming in Python, starting from common everyday code and scenarios. At the end of the course, you’ll be able to go and learn on your own, for example with docs, tutorials, or books.

## RGB Matrix Support Extended to the STM32F4 Feather

[![RGB Matrix support in CircuitPython](../assets/20200512/20200512matrix.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/05/10/testing-out-rgb-matrix-support-in-circuitpython-for-stm32f405-st_world-stmicroelectronics/)

CircuitPython received a native library to drive RGB matrices last month using the SAMD51 and nRF52840 microcontrollers. This week, Limor "Ladyada" Fried tests out support in the library for the ST Microelectronics STM32F405 chip available in CircuitPython 5.3.0 - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1259627565184147457) and [Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/05/10/testing-out-rgb-matrix-support-in-circuitpython-for-stm32f405-st_world-stmicroelectronics/).

## CircuitPython Support in the Atom Editor

[![Atom](../assets/20200512/20200512atom.jpg)](https://github.com/jos-b/language-circuitpython)

CircuitPython language support in Atom. Support for serial outputs, Python REPL, and plotting of data. The plugin contains the code from the fsync-on-save package to ensure data is flushed to the device immediately after saving, therefore preventing loss or corruption of data when working with CircuitPython devices.

Should be compatible with Windows & Linux as the serial port library should be cross-platform, let me know in the issues of any errors cropping up.

The maintainer is open to any form of feedback in the form of GitHub Issues or ping joseph#1337 in the #circuitpython channel of the Adafruit Discord Server - [GitHub](https://github.com/jos-b/language-circuitpython).

## Python Language Support in Microsoft MakeCode

[![MakeCode for micro:bit 2020](../assets/20200512/20200512-2020.jpg)](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000112967-beta-testing-makecode-2020-update)

Beta Testing - MakeCode 2020 for micro:bit Update which includes Python language support:

> ...range of new features and improvements (are) available in the [MakeCode Editor 2020 beta](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta) available now. You can also find details about this update on the [MakeCode Blog](https://makecode.com/blog/) and a [walkthrough on mixer](https://mixer.com/MakeCode?vod=BXbuThA-bUKzLCLH7RRTbA).

## cyberDUCK - a self-contained computer that edits and runs CircuitPython

[![cyberDUCK](../assets/20200512/20200512duck.jpg)](https://hackaday.io/project/171269-cyberdck-a-circuitpython-anatidae)

cyberDUCK is billed as a self-contained computer that can edit and run Python files, with USB keyboard input and a display. And it’s shaped like a disaster-recovery duck - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CycleMatch/status/1258246572766265350), [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/171269-cyberdck-a-circuitpython-anatidae), and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/bv5wRY0CV68).

Key features:
- USB Keyboard input
- Display for showing output
- A text editor for creating and editing Python code
- A "REPL"-like command line for entering Python commands (to edit a file, run a file, etc.)

The project uses many strategies to achieve this. As a prototype, the project deliberately takes bits and pieces from others and using glue, Fun-Tak, feathers and bailing wire to make it work.  

- Use a co-processor to take input from a USB keyboard (Arduino-based USB Host for SAMD with software modified from code by gdsports)
- Transmit keyboard input to main processor using UART
- Use a "REPL-interceptor" to allow text input from UART to control the command execution of python input from the keyboard
- Adapt a text editor MicroPython-editor (pye) from robert-hh to run on a CircuitPython Board with attached display. This will edit files by taking input from UART and output to the attached display.  File storage is using on-board non-volatile memory or a memory card

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

The name of the game this week is filters! I've been working on the Arduino library for what I'm now calling the "LIS331" family of high to extremely high g accelerometers. Vibrations are everywhere and since accelerometers are really good at measuring them, to be able to find the data or signal you're interested in from all those measurements it can be useful to be able to say "I definitely don't care about all of that". If you've got a needle in a haystack,  a good first step to find the needle is saying "well, I know the needle isn't in this half," and then proceeding to feed that half to the cows. 

This is where filters come in. Just like a coffee filter that keeps the big grounds of coffee out of your cup, a filter for a sensor like an accelerometer can separate one big pile of stuff into two or more piles of stuff based on some criteria. In the case of a coffee filter, the criteria is "is this piece of stuff small enough that I don't mind having it in my coffee cup?" When talking about measurements from sensors, there’s a lot of different criteria you could use to filter the data, but a common one and one that is built into the LIS331 and many other sensors is filtering based on the frequency of the signal or how fast the signal is changing. Frequency is commonly measured in Hertz or cycles per second.

Here is a graph of the output from the H3LIS331DL while I’m using a tool to create high frequency vibration that causes the acceleration felt by the sensor to change rapidly:

In the area surrounded by the red box, you can see that the graph is pretty jagged and “peaky” because it’s displaying as much as it can of the different acceleration values regardless of frequency. Note the line marked “25” which I've added to this and the next plot as a reference point because the Arduino plotter automatically re-scales the graph.

Now check out this graph of the same vibrations with the built in low pass filter removing all of the signal changing faster than 37 times a second or 37 Hertz:

[![Bryan](../assets/20200512/20200512bryan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Compared to the previous plot, you can see that the graphs look much cleaner because the high peaks and valleys for each graph have been subdued. This is the 37Hz Low Pass Filter doing its job of only passing along data that is cycling slower than 37Hz.

These sensors also have support for a high pass filter which I’m also working on though I’ll have to come up with a better testing method to verify the output.

I'm finishing up the [Adafruit BLE Services library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE_Adafruit). It provides BLE services that work with the [Bluefruit Playground app](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-playground-app). I have CircuitPython programs that communicate with the app, in the same way that the [Arduino UF2's we supply](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-playground-app/firmware) do.

The app is not the only way to use the Adafruit Services library. You'll be able to use the library as a BLE central as well, to get sensor data or control NeoPixels or DotStars.

The library required some changes to the PacketBuffer class core CircuitPython BLE support. I finally finished those changes earlier this week after some false starts.

Next up:
Getting CircuitPython download data automatically again, now that we've switched from GitHub artifacts to Amazon S3 storage for release downloads.
Implementing **\_bleio** using the **bleak** library on host computers.
Trying to communicate with a BLE-capable fever thermometer.

As seen elsewhere in the newsletter, I helped with the setup of Weblate, to make it easier for the community to contribute translations of CircuitPython.  Please help us out by adding or improving translations.

I started a new project this week to create a version of adafruit_sdcard which is written in C instead of in Python.  We hope that this new version will have higher performance and leave more memory free for your Python code and objects.  Initial results for a single file on a single card show that reading a large file 4096 bytes at a time became about 40% faster.  However, additional testing on multiple SD cards and CircuitPython boards is indicated.

While working on the code, I was inserting and removing the SD card repeatedly.  I think mechanical stress was probably the reason this card broke in two, but software bugs are not entirely ruled out :wink:

This week I finished up the CircuitPython library GitHub issue sweep. Between following up with original authors and putting in a few PRs of my own, I managed to close at least 50 issues. As well, I went back through and made sure to label every issue I could, and reply to those I could not. The list available on the [Contributing page on circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/contributing) is sortable by issue label, and now that information is far more useful as each issue is now labeled. If you're interested in contributing to CircuitPython, check it out, it's a great place to start. Good First Issues are available for those who are new or looking for something simple. Otherwise you can look into bug fixes, enhancement requests or documentation updates if you're interested in something a bit more involved. Check it out and feel free to ping us with any questions!

This week I've been handling mostly bugfixes and reviews, along with some new additions. I added a basic port of the OpenMV, a camera development board hosting the powerful STM32 H743 SoC - a somewhat anemic addition, given that Circuitpython does not support cameras (yet!), but it's also the first third party H7 board supported by the port. Other additions this week included DisplayIO support on the H7 and F7 series, and some initial revisions to the i.MX port to support uni-directional SPI. This week I'll be following up the i.MX work to flesh out the QoL features in Microcontroller, including pin claiming, peripheral reservation, and the like.

On my personal time, I spent a somewhat regrettable amount of effort yesterday getting unicode Japanese support on an e-paper featherwing. My ambition is to eventually have a lightweight smart flashcards system (inspired by Anki) on Circuitpython to study math and languages without a backlight. It's sadly not very impressive yet - the display takes a whopping 40 seconds to update just a handful of glyphs - but asking around it seems there may be some accessible ways to speed it up. Hosting the font on an SD card rather than internal flash will also allow more fleshed out character support.

This past week I focused mostly on adding the I2C protocol to the Adafruit_CircuitPython_BitbangIO library. This was fairly difficult because it seemed any existing examples implementing this were written just slightly differently or largely incomplete. One of the sources that I found most helpful was looking at how CircuitPython had implemented it and using that as a base worked pretty well. I also checked the output when running hardware I2C with my logic analyzer and compared that to the output and I was able to get some good data when I tested with the BME280.

After that, I started working on adding support for the GreatFET one to Blinka. This was inspired by a tweet that I saw by Michael Ossmann where he mentioned that you could run a GreatFET One with Python and the fact that I had received one from Kate Tempkin at the Hackaday SuperCon this past year. I already have it being detected and it seems like it will be pretty straightforward to add.

This week I've been working on CircuitPython for the ESP32-S2. It's all hacked together but I've managed to get the REPL working. On [my stream last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emvVydYoGxw), I added pin definitions and talked about the linker errors I was hitting. This week, I fixed the linker errors and fixed a few issues at startup with FreeRTOS and TinyUSB. The REPL is now working!!!

The next steps are to get the flash working for the CIRCUITPY drive and then polish it up and merge it. Tune into my live streams, Fridays at 2pm Pacific, for the latest info.
