## Learning Resources

**Learning Python from Scratch**

An article with ten recommendations on resources on the internet for learning beginning Python, from someone knowing absolutely no coding to course catalogs - [GitHub](https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/learning-python.html).

**Practical Python** - [David Beazley](https://dabeaz.com) has make this excellent course available under a Creative Commons license - [GitHub.io Post](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/) and [GitHub Materials](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python)

> Students of this course are usually professional scientists, engineers, and programmers who already have experience in at least one other programming language. No prior knowledge of Python is required, but knowledge of common programming topics is assumed. Most participants find the course challenging–even if they’ve already been doing a bit of Python programming.

**An Overview of CircuitPython in Japanese**

Irieda presents an overview of CircuitPython (in Japanese) - [144Lab](https://tech.144lab.com/entry/2019/10/01/CircuitPython%E3%81%AE%E7%B4%B9%E4%BB%8B).

## Write code in a web browser with GitHub Classroom

[![GitHub Classroom](../assets/20200602/20200602github.jpg)](https://github.blog/2020-05-26-code-in-the-browser-with-github-classroom/)

Microsoft and GitHub announce that they are making online integrated development environments (IDEs) such that students can get right to work in a web browser, avoiding software conflicts that might happen with code installs on their local machines.

Code on a laptop or with a tablet—students won’t be slowed down by their devices. Students can get started quickly in the same coding environment, so educators may teach instead of troubleshooting.

Currently integration includes MakeCode Arcade which will likely receive Python programmability later this year as it is rolled out across the MakeCode family - [GitHub](https://github.blog/2020-05-26-code-in-the-browser-with-github-classroom/).

## Python 3.9: What’s new and better

[![Python 3.9 Beta](../assets/20200602/20200602-39.jpg)](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3543885/python-39-whats-new-and-better.html)

The Python Software Foundation has announced the [first beta of Python 3.9](https://blog.python.org/2020/05/python-390b1-is-now-available-for.html), scheduled for production release in October. With the release of the beta, all of the major changes of Python 3.9 are set. Python has been previously developed and released every eighteen-months. [PEP 602](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0602/) was acceptetd with the Python development team adopting an annual release cycle.

The new timeline means Python 3.9 will ship in October 2020. Python 3.10 officially started pre-alpha development on May 19, 2020, will enter the alpha development phase when Python 3.9 ships, and will ship in October 2021. Future Python releases will follow the same pattern - [InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3543885/python-39-whats-new-and-better.html) and the [Python Blog](https://blog.python.org/2020/05/python-390b1-is-now-available-for.html).

## The Zen of Python, the PEP and a New Song

[![The Zen of Python](../assets/20200602/20200602zen.jpg)](https://wefearchange.org/2020/05/zenofpython.rst.html)

The Zen of Python is a well-known collections of aphorisms, koans that describe the aesthetics of the Python language, as channeled by a famous early and still current Pythonista Tim Peters in 2004 and codified as PEP20 - [Python.org](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).

> It was a throwaway python-list post. But like all great triumphs of literature, it was written during commercials breaks while watching professional wrestling on TV, and munching on a ham sandwich. All true!

Barry Warsaw recently wrote a song and lyrics based on the Zen of Python under the terms of a Creative Commons CC BY-NA-SA 4.0 license- [We Fear Change](https://wefearchange.org/2020/05/zenofpython.rst.html).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20200602/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep an eye out here for more updated download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This past week has seen me returning to working on the libraries for the ST ICM20948 9-DoF motion sensor. You may recall from previous updates that this chip integrates its magnetometer a bit differently. While it's common to see multiple sensors integrated into the same package, it is not all that common to see one of the included sensors accessed through one of its neighbors in the package.

Like some other chips, the ICM20948 includes an external I2C bus that can be used to integrate with and control additional sensors through the same libraries. This is likely done to allow flexibility with what sensors are used to augment the existing ones. In the case of the ICM20948, the gyro and accelerometer are bundled together in the same register space, however the integrated [AK09916 3-axis magnetometer/compass by AsahiKASEI](https://www.y-ic.es/datasheet/78/SMDSW.020-2OZ.pdf) is connected to the external I2C bus controlled by the ICM20948!

The result of this is that the normal configuration of the magnetometer has to be orchestrated by the I2C master controller in the ICM20948. The biggest struggle I've had while working on these libraries, and indeed any library was surrounding this orchestration. To make a long story short, in certain situations the I2C master controller in the ICM20948 would get into a bad state and not be able to communicate with the magnetometer.

As the song goes, "I get by [with a little help from my friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends)" and indeed our friends at SparkFun had already ran into and solved this issue in their [Arduino](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_ICM-20948_ArduinoLibrary) and [Python](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_9DoF_IMU_ICM20948_Py) libraries. The solution was to check for a bad connection by trying to read from the sensor a number of times, then resetting the I2C master if it was unsuccessful. Indeed I had tried this, however the key was that they continued this cycle until the sensor responded or a given number of failed attempts.

**Big thanks to SparkFun engineers Pete Lewis, Nathan Seidle, Owen and others** for saving my bacon!

As a result of the newfound stability of the magnetometer, I was able to add in support for adjusting the data rate of the magnetometer, so I have some pretty graphs for you! First is the magnetometer measuring at 10Hz:

**Dan**

I'm re-implementing the CircuitPython [\_bleio](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/_bleio/index.html) API using [bleak](https://pypi.org/project/bleak/). So far I've implemented scanning for advertisements. The bleak library uses Python's asyncio capabilities but \_bleio is a conventional "sync" interface. So I I spent time learning the details of using asyncio with threads, and used the [janus.queue](https://github.com/aio-libs/janus) library to pass data between the sync and async worlds as it arrives. It works on Linux and Windows, but I'm having issues with MacOS due to threads, and have submitted a bug report.

The next step is to extract as much information from the bleak scanning results as possible. The \_bleio scanning interface passes back more information than is available via bleak, so I have to figure out what is essential and simulate or avoid the rest.

I've been working on support for SD cards using a potentially-faster interface called SDIO.  This is the way the SD card is connected on the STM32F405 Feather, and is not currently usable from CircuitPython, which only understands SD cards connected via SPI.  My early results show that when reading bulk data directly from the SD card (not using a FAT filesystem), some pretty impressive data rates.  Next up, I'll give the same treatment to the SAMD51 port of CircuitPython.

This week I continued working with LED animations and published the CircuitPython LED Animations guide. There's nothing like writing a guide for a library to find bugs in that library. So, along with the guide came a series of bug fixes and GitHub issues for bugs that weren't as urgent. As for the guide, apparently making 31 animated GIFs takes much longer than I expected, so it took a bit longer than I originally planned. But the guide turned out really well. If you're interested in displaying animations on your NeoPixels or DotStars, check out the [CircuitPython LED Animation library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_LED_Animation) and the [associated guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-led-animations).

Next up is porting the Arduino AHTx0 library to CircuitPython for the AHT10 sensor.

This past week I've mostly been bug-hunting on the mimxrt10xx, adding in pin reset features and stress testing busio as much as possible. My time has been cut a little by the fact that my home office has been unbearably hot during the summer days, but I'll be returning to the core of Boston soon for a (hopefully) more regular schedule. 

In the coming week I'll be working pulseio for the i.MX port, and possibly revisiting STM32 for some older bugs and other issues I turned up while working on the i.MX's implementations.

This past week, I was pretty focussed on porting displayio over to Blinka. This was really a lot of fun and I probably spent more time working on it than I normally do on projects, but I also got a lot out of it.

One of the more interesting challenges was having the Raspberry Pi writing to the display without blocking the user's script. The way I got around that was to implement threading for the display and as depending on whether auto_refresh was on or off, it would automatically start or stop the thread.

I also implemented fontio as part of it so that we could have even more compatibility between the CircuitPython and Blinka platforms. The way that it works is that it uses Pillow to render its fallback font and then converts that into a displayio Bitmap for complete compatibility. I was able to get the font transparencies working as well.

One of the more pleasant surprises I had was during testing in that I had written it to be compatible enough, that it ran the example for the Display Shapes library perfectly and I wasn't even expecting it to run.

There's still a lot of items to tackle to make it complete, but you can find the library at [https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_Displayio](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_Displayio) if you would like to experiment with it or work on some of the issues.

The improvements to the ESP32S2 port for pin tracking and digitalio has been merged. I've started on busio and will stream more about that work this week. Thanks to Ivan for helping me get over some hurdles with that.
