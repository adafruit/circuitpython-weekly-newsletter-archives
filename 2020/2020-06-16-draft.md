## CircuitPython Bluetooth BLE Library Support for Desktop Python

[![CircuitPython Bracelet](../assets/20200616/20200616ble.jpg)](https://youtu.be/uW1eNPrLBi8)

Ladyada has been trying out the NEW BLE CircuitPython library support for desktop ([video](https://youtu.be/uW1eNPrLBi8)). Having easy, cross-platform python support for wireless BLE has been a challenge for many years. Thanks to Dan Halbert’s great work on CircuitPython bleio and the Python bleak library, we now have many of our CircuitPython BLE examples working on desktop Python! Finally, heart rate monitors, bike cadence sensors, thermometers, and more, can be connected to Python! - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/uW1eNPrLBi8) and the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/06/11/trying-out-our-new-ble-circuitpython-library-support-for-desktop/).

## GitHub Changes Announced

Chrome developer Una Kravets asked GitHub to follow Google in its move to use the term "main" instead of "master" in Git last week.  GitHub CEO Nat Friedman answered promptly on June 12th, revealing that the company was already working on the issue. Adafruit supports the change. GitHub lending its backing to this movement effectively ensures the term will be removed across millions of projects, and effectively legitimizes the effort to clean up software terminology that started this month - [Tweets](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1271253144442253312) and [ZDnet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/).

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep checking back for updated download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I've finished the initial version of the [Adafruit_Blinka_bleio](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_bleio) library, which lets you use CircuitPython BLE code on host computers, like the rest of the [Blinka](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka) library. The same programs that run on CircuitPython on our BLE-capable boards now run without change  on Linux and Windows. I'm testing with a heart rate monitor, BBQ thermometer, a BLE light bulb, and other such devices.

There are still some stumbling blocks for MacOS, and there are some limitations in the current implementation of [bleak](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak), the underlying library I'm using, that prevent using [Adafruit Services](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE_Adafruit). We're looking into overcoming these issues. Nevertheless, bleak has worked out quite well so far, and it is impressive how it supports such disparate platforms with a single clean API.

The overall structure of the code is in place, but it doesn't work yet.  The Grand Central board is trying to communicate with the card to retrieve the card ID, but nothing is received in return.  Investigation continues, and the vital clue is sure to turn up soon.

**Kattni**

I began this week by getting ahead on creating Fritzing objects for upcoming hardware so they're ready for the guides as the hardware becomes ready to ship. I did 10 in total, including two FeatherWings, which adds to the level of complication. I was also asked to update a guide to include a FeatherWing version of the LSM6DSOX + LIS3MDL - Precision 9 DoF IMU breakout, but it turns out the guide was never created in the first place. So, now I'm working on creating the guide.

I'll be working on going through a list of CircuitPython supported boards that have duplicate VID/PID numbers, and determining whether it's intentional or needs to be changed. We've added a check to verify duplicate VID/PIDs, so we won't have to deal with it moving forward, but it means going through all the current boards with duplicates and making judgement calls. Details can be found in [CircuitPython issue #2962](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/2962).

**Lucian**

This past week I rewrote the clock setup system for the STM32 port - a lot of the code was pretty old, and not especially flexible, so it was causing crashes and other issues when combined with the new low power code. The new system reduces all the clock settings (including both the primary clock controller, the RCC, and the low power real-time clock, the RTC) down to a set of defaults that a board can choose to overwrite. This gives board contributors a lot of flexibility over what clock settings they want in case they'd like to lower their power use, use specific peripherals that require certain frequencies, etc. It also resolves bugs with the low power code that were causing crashes with certain modules, and generally improves speed and power efficiency over most dev boards. 

I also spent some time working on the i.MX port, solving some simple but tricky-to-track bugs on the Teensy 4.0 and 4.1, and got set up with the RGBMatrix code on STM32. My current project is cleaning up a number of older issues with the H7 and F7 series that never quite got cleaned up. Yesterday I added tightly-coupled memory (TCM) support to the F7 series, and I'm currently wrapping up an issue with the calculation of I2C timing. With luck I'll be out of the debugging weeds soon, to get back to RGBMatrix support and hopefully submit some projects of my own to the community bundle. 

**Melissa**

This past week I've been focusing on displayio once again. I have been going through each of the displays and making sure they all work as well as adding features such as basic backlight control and display rotation. This will be really useful for making use of the displays that are designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi and other boards with similar 40-pin connectors.

This past week I finished up busio.I2C on the ESP32-S2. Thanks to MarkOlsson for pointing out a problem with ACK/NAK that got a sensor working. Once that was done, I added pin validation and pull up checking. Next up is UART and SPI. I'll also be doing a new beta release shortly.
