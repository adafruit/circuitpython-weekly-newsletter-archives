Hi everyone! It's the latest Python for Microcontrollers newsletter brought you by the community! Find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). Let's get started!

## CircuitPython snakes its way to the Teensy 4.0

[![IoTeensy](../assets/01142020/11420teensy.png)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/01/10/testing-circuitpython-on-teensy-4-0-iot-made-easy-ioteensy-adafruit-circuitpython-arturo182-tannewt-nxp-paulstoffregen/)

CircuitPython is now available for [Paul Stoffregen's](https://twitter.com/PaulStoffregen/status/1216482624799068161) [Teeny 4.0.](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html) This is super-early, not optimized, cutting-edge... there is a ready-to-use HEX file to experiment with. Open it with Teensy Loader and program onto your Teensy 4.0, for CircuitPython at 600 MHz.

[Join the discussion](https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/59040-CircuitPython-on-Teensy-4!) on the Teensy forums, on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), and please file any and all issues here! - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/new).

[![IoTeensy](../assets/01142020/11420ioteensy.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ICg_3I4jvKo)

In 20 minutes, actually less than that, we were able to make an IoTeensy project. Scott and Artur have done an amazing job bringing CircuitPython to the NXP iMX RT1062, this chip holds a lot of promise! We threw together a quick IoT project to test I2C and SPI – the OLED is an I2C device, and the AirLift Featherwing provides WiFi over SPI. This demo connects to opur AP, then queries the adafruit quote service to get an inspirational quote every 3 seconds. The JSON is parsed, split, and displayed on the OLED by scrolling. Was really fast to put together, only about 20 minutes and 100 lines of code - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ICg_3I4jvKo).

## CircuitPython i.MX Feather progress

Things are moving fast for a CircuitPython i.MX Feather(s)! Some updated renderings - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1216033357940895744). The board also were taken out to a nice photoshoot! - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1215036958956806144?s=12).

And hackster.io has some coverage on ["Arturo182's NXP i.MX RT10xx Port Into CircuitPython Codebase"](https://www.hackster.io/news/adafruit-accepts-arturo182-s-nxp-i-mx-rt10xx-port-into-circuitpython-codebase-0592ee356cd4).

## Python slithers its way to Arduino

[![Arduino](../assets/01142020/11420mpardu.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/01/07/python-snakes-its-way-to-the-arduino-portenta-h7-arduino-micropython/)

Looks like Arduino will be supporting Python in some way very soon, maybe?! In the [promo video](https://twitter.com/arduino/status/1214564465967955968) it lists “MicroPython” and on the [overview page](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/hardware/product/portenta-h7) “MicroPython / JavaScript via an interpreter” it’s available for [pre-order for $99](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-h7).

[![Arduino](../assets/01142020/11420board_iso-withlogo.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/01/07/python-snakes-its-way-to-the-arduino-portenta-h7-arduino-micropython/)

This is a powerful STM32H747XI dual Cortex®-M7+M4 32bit chip that runs pretty fast – SDRAM was added, and flash storage. If you’re going to want to get [TinyUSB](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) running on this thing, we have support for the STM32 H7 series. The board is Feather-like, and has a STEMMA/QWIIC-like connector, that's good to see that direction as that is where the market went.

[![Arduino](../assets/01142020/11420PYBD_SF6_W4F2.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/01/07/python-snakes-its-way-to-the-arduino-portenta-h7-arduino-micropython/)

The Portenta kinda reminds us of the [Pyboard D-series with STM32F767 and WiFi/BT from MicroPython](https://store.micropython.org/product/PYBD-SF6-W4F2), it has similar connectors on the bottom, fast chip, Wifi/BT, etc.

Alasdair Allan over on [hackster.io](http://hackster.io/) has the best coverage so far, [go check out the full article](https://www.hackster.io/news/the-new-arduino-portenta-5ae687010500).

## CircuitPython 2020, where do we want to go together?

[![Dan](../assets/01142020/11420dan02.png)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I'm testing the BLE bonding code. Some lower-level code needs to change because the bonding event handlers need to live past the lifetime of the CircuitPython virtual machine; Scott had to do something similar already and was helpful on this. I got tired of adjusting the volume on my computer's speakers by mouse-clicking, and built a mash-up of the [Media Dial](https://learn.adafruit.com/media-dial) and [Rotary Encoder](https://learn.adafruit.com/rotary-encoder) Learn Guide projects to send Consumer Control HID codes to my computer (volume up, down, and mute). I 3-D printed a [simplification of the Medial Dial from Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2910656), did a little code hacking, and it's working just fine. One issue is that since it's CircuitPython, it shows up as CIRCUITPY and as a serial device whenever it's plugged in. Since I want to leave it plugged in, and I'm constantly debugging other CircuitPython boards, I built a special version of CircuitPython with the mass storage and serial USB devices turned off. I can't edit on the board anymore, but I added a reset button so I can always go back to the bootloader, reload regular CircuitPython, and work on the program again.

This week I've been continuing the work to migrate our 200+ CircuitPython libraries to GitHub Actions. It's a big project! The end is in sight, but there's still a notable amount of work to go. It's not a flashy set of features or new release but it is an important step in making such a large number of projects manageable. Along a similar vein, I also did some work to update some existing libraries to support additional similar libraries, as well as assisting on moving some Arduino libraries to Actions. True, I haven't worked on any new boards so far this week but there are plenty in the pipeline!

**Jeff**  

Over the past week I have been picking up a lot of miscellaneous items, such as missing features in DigitalIO for seesaw I/O expander boards, a lockup that can occur when using bitmaps or audio files from SD cards together with SD accesses from other CircuitPython code, and crashes when requesting lots of bytes (or -1 byte!) from os.urandom. Yes, I literally worked on random bugs.

**Kattni**  

This week I finished up the [CircuitPython Made Easy on Circuit Playground Express and Bluefruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-made-easy-on-circuit-playground-express) and it is finally ready to go. If you're looking for the simplest way to use CircuitPython with either the Circuit Playground Express or Bluefruit, check out this guide. It includes the new Bluefruit-only features as well!  I spent the day going through all the open PRs on all the CircuitPython libraries. We have some very old PRs that needed attention. If you submitted a PR to any of the libraries over the last year that we missed, please check your email or GitHub for updates or possible change requests. If you have an open PR that we still need to address, please don't hesitate to let us know via GitHub or Discord. Thank you for all your contributions! Other than that, I'm planning to finish up my CircuitPython 2020 post, and a few miscellaneous things that came out of the Circuit Playground library update; there's an example that needs to be updated, some cleaner error handling added, as well as the README needing both an update and an explanation of how the library works. Once that's done, it'll be on to something new!

This past week I finished up the Animated Gif Player and its associated learn guide. You can check out the [learn guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/pitft-linux-python-animated-gif-player). Since I thought it would be fun, I created an animated gif of the player playing an animated Gif. I also wrote up an epic Blog post for my thoughts on CircuitPython 2020 as well as my story about how I started at Adafruit. You can check out the [Blog post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/01/07/a-story-this-past-year-from-melissa-and-some-thoughts-on-the-future-on-circuitpython-in-2020-circuitpython2020-makermelissa/). I have been also picking up on working on the Blinka project, the CircuitPython compatibility layer for Raspberry Pi and other Single Board Computers. There has been some extra activity from community member contributions and that has been excellent to see.

**Scott**  

On the first of 2020 we kicked off the #circuitpython2020 planning. I've been posting all of the awesome responses on the Adafruit Blog. Our end date is January 13th's CircuitPython Community meeting (join Discord for details). I've also been wrapping up BLE work on packet aware protocols like the Apple Media Service and BLE MIDI. We swapped the CircuitPython HID library to take in a list of devices as well so that BLE HID devices can be used in place of USB HID devices. I've been meaning to write my own #circuitpython2020 post and talk about the need for focus, buuuuuuuttt I got distracted by @arturo182's PR for iMX RT support in CircuitPython. It is very exciting, the chips are faster and some have more RAM (1MB!). In my distraction, I've added support for more dev boards including the Teensy 4!
