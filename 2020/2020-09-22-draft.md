Hi everyone! It's the latest Python for Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## CircuitPython 6.0.0 Beta 0

[![CircuitPython 6.0.0 Beta 0](../assets/20200922/20200922CP6.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

CircuitPython version 6.0.0 beta 0 is the initial beta release of CircuitPython 6.0.0. The most notable additions since 5.3.x are basic lower power support when in time.sleep(), initial ESP32-S2 support, including WiFi, and and \_bleio HCI support for ESP32 co-processors. The lower power work changed time keeping and may have introduced bugs. Please use 5.3.x if you need a stable version of CircuitPython. See the [Release Notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases) for all the changes.

## The State of OSHdata and Open Hardware

[![The State of OSHdata and Open Hardware](../assets/20200922/20200922oshwa.jpg)](https://oshdata.com/2020/09/17/the-state-of-oshdata/)

An update on the OSHdata project and what is happening next in the broader Open Source Hardware community, looking ahead to Open Hardware Month in October.

> [Our research](https://oshdata.com/2020/02/19/2020-state-of-open-hardware/) has been read in over 40 countries around the world, on every continent—except Antarctica. Our report helped increase awareness of the certification program and created a sense of friendly competition between some of the leading Open Source Hardware companies in the world. Since our report was first published, the program went from slightly over 400 certifications to now boasting over 1,000 certifications!

A more than doubling of the certification program was led by Adafruit, who are now the leading creator with nearly 40% of all certifications. To mark the time when they claimed the top slot, Adafruit founder Limor Fried was interviewed - [OSHdata](https://oshdata.com/2020/05/04/limor-fried-of-adafruit-industries/).

> The Open Source Hardware movement is a global movement. It’s not just about leading brands like Adafruit, SparkFun, Olimex, or Field Ready. It’s also not about the big companies are involved in this space and have certified hardware, like Google or BeagleBoard. Open hardware is built by people you know, and by people you may not know yet. We have worked hard to shine a spotlight on the up-and-coming creators.

The CircuitPython BNO080 library is now the CircuitPython \_BNO08x_ library which is a simple way of making it clear that it works with both the BNO080 and BNO085 sensors from Hillcrest Labs. Other than a name change, the library will be released by the time you read this along with newly added calibration code. If you've ever had to move your phone around in wonky 3-dimensional figure eights, not unlike making a toy airplane doing some maneuvers, you've gone through a calibration procedure like the BNO08x sensors are capable of. 

Magnetometers sense magnetic fields like the that surrounds the earth and makes sure your compass points north. This can be handy because unless something has gone \_horribly wrong_, magnetic north will always be to the North (more or less). Motion. sensors can use this outside reference to correct any errors in their calculations but doing so accurately requires accounting for all of the other stray magnetic fields in the sensor's environment. Most multi-axis sensors with magnetometers have a way of storing this offset information and usign it to correct the readings, but you generally have to do the work of calculating it yourself. The BNO08x sensors do all that work for you. In essence you say "start calibrating" then move the sensor into 4-5 different orientations until it's told you that it's calibrated. All you have to do after that is tell it to save the calibration data and voila! A calibrated super-fancy motion sensor.

The [Blinka \_bleio library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_bleio) is now working on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Some recent changes to the MacOS support in the [bleak library](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak) fixed the issues we were having with \_bleio on MacOS. I will also vet the Linux support on Raspberry Pi soon. I'll have a PR soon after that, and then will start working on a Learn Guide with setup steps and examples for all the platforms.

I finished the small [Airlift helper library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_AirLift), which helps manage ESP32 co-processors for use with WiFi and Bluetooth.

Since I last checked in about it, I've made a lot of good progress on the CAN bus support for SAM E5x microcontrollers.  Sending and receiving now work, as well as recovery from bus errors.  Addition of filtering and 29-bit IDs is next.

In this demo, the sender waits for the buttons to be pressed and sends messages to the receiver, which displays it.

This past week and a half I spent fixing bugs in Circuitpython. The most critical fix was removing a number of null reference exceptions that were occurring in DisplayIO for I2C based screens, like the OLED Featherwing - these were initially assumed to only be happening on the ESP32-S2, but turned out to be present across all ports. These errors may have slipped under the radar because they only appeared when certain things went wrong - if the user typed their I2C address incorrectly, for instance, or if they forgot to include a pin by default in their constructor. Unfortunately, their reliance on hardware makes these kinds of issues tricky to unit test, and I'm still thinking about ways around that issue.

I also helped wrap up an issue that was preventing SD cards from working on the STM32, related to how ST's SPI peripheral deals with the write line when a read is going on. There's a particular parameter for the read function that can set a temporary output value for the write line, holding it high or low, or even putting out a single repeating byte of data, which is something SD cards require - however, most ports ignore this in their implementation. This wasn't an issue for the NRF52, which the ST port's SPI code was based off of, because the default for that chip works correctly with SD cards, but the STM32 had all kinds of undefined behavior. It's possible the same issue is now happening on ESP32-S2, so I'll be checking that out next.

I'm now moving on to bugs on the STM32 version of RGBMatrix, which should simply be a matter of inspecting a lot of data lines on the SAMD and NRF52 versions and looking for differences.

As a fun project, I finally got my Circuitpython library for the Dynamixel brand of robot servos submitted to the community bundle, and finished my first Featherwing:

[![Lucian](../assets/20200922/20200922lucian1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The board contains the basic logic needed to turn a Feather's two UART RX and TX lines into the single half-duplex line that the Dynamixels use, as well as including a simple direction control circuit using buffers. It also lets you plug in a 12V cable directly to supply the motors, and has a built-in regulator and power source selector if you'd like to run Circuitpython off the motor power line instead of USB.

I'm looking forward to trying out some new projects, now that my robot servos aren't tied to a fragile breadboard circuit to handle their direction control - next up is figuring out quadruped gaits!

This past week was a short week for me as I traveled away from the smoke that was particularly hazardous in my local area. Outside of that, I finished up writing the CircuitPython Pixel Framebuf library and got it added to the bundle. It leverages the power of the existing framebuf library and the Animated LED library to display text and graphics on many different configurations of NeoPixels and DotStars. I started writing a guide on using this library. Keep an eye out if you're interested because it should be published soon. 

If you're too excited to wait and would like to dive right in by looking at examples, [the repository is available now](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Pixel_Framebuf).

**Scott**

This week I've been doing a smattering of different ESP32-S2 related tasks to get everything ready for more and more boards. I started by fixing SPI on boards with PSRAM. I finished up the changes to Adafruit_Requests so that it works with existing libraries and the new native wifi code.

There is a PR for adding support for different flash sizes: 8MB and 16MB in addition to 4MB.

I'm also sorting out USB PIDs. I finished up the CI check for unique USB PIDs for boards. I've been helping http://pid.codes get caught up on PR merges.

Next up is polishing up the UF2 bootloader for the ESP32-S2. I'll be writing a guide to adding your own board to the UF2 bootloader. The goal is to make it easy to load UF2 once so that all the loading after that can be done with a USB drive.

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
