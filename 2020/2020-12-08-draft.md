Hi everyone! It's the latest Python for Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## Low Power Support Available on ESP32-S2

[![ESP32-S2 Low Power](../assets/20201208/20201208sleep.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0XAT8V37-g&feature=youtu.be)

Low power capability in CircuitPython has come in the form of low power modes for the ESP32-S2 chip. Other chips will be following shortly, if they are hardware capable. The details are in [Pull Request #3767](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/3767) merged last week into the nighly builds of CircuitPython for the ESP32-S2. While normally the recommendation would be to use CircuitPython 6.1.0-beta.2, the "Absolute Newest" on S3, an available option, is recommended for ESP32-S2 boards.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This week I finished the CircuitPython library for the MLX90395, the 3-Axis magnetometer I mentioned last week. I continue to be mildly obsessed with this sensor as well as the TLV493 and other chips that use advanced magnetic sensing to unlock new methods of solving old and new problems.

I must have magnets on the brain as I recently saw a perfect application for these types of sensors: A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B1H5syp4PM) by [Tom Stanton](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC67gfx2Fg7K2NSHqoENVgwA), an engineer on YouTube, about a [diaphragm based air powered engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B1H5syp4PM). In the video he builds a small engine to power a model airplane, but that uses compressed air to power the planes flight, just like an Air Hog. 

Tom was presented with the problem of synchronizing the release of air pressure on the diaphragm with the rotation of the crankshaft without compromising the diaphragm's air seal. Tom, [being a talented engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVT5i4nhIGs), proceeded to engineer his way out of the problem by designing a mechanically timed valve system with seals to prevent air leaks. But what if he could access the crank's position without needing a physical connection to the crank? I'd be interested to see what it would do to the design to replace his valve with a servo-actuated valve to release the diaphragm pressure, as well as a magnet on the crank and magnetic sensor nearby.

I believe this would simplify the design by keeping the diaphragm value and crank sensor physically separate, and avoiding using one mechanism to sense the position of the crank as well as release the diaphragm pressure. As I write this however, I realize that my proposed "improvement" would require the addition of a battery to power both the diaphragm valve and crank sensing circuitry. Tom has used hall-effect sensors in another video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgqflcHBTwc so he certainly knows how to use them, so I'm willing to bet that keeping the design entirely mechanical and air powered was a design goal from the beginning.

I finished the initial version of deep (and light) sleep in CircuitPython, and it's now merged into the main line in the CircuitPython repo. The API went through a few more revisions over the past week. By the time you read this, CircuitPython 6.1.0-beta.2 will have been released, and will include deep sleep. For now, sleep is only implemented on the ESP32-S2.

Thanks to Scott and @microDev1 for the initial work on deep sleep!

[![Jeff's Project](../assets/20201208/20201208jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This week I published a project guide showing how to control youtube playback on a Raspberry Pi based on readings from a Bluetooth BLE cadence sensor on a stationary bike. Check out the guide: [Raspberry Pi Pedal for Youtube](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-pedal-for-youtube).

This week I published the [CircuitPython Animated Holiday Wreath Lights](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-animated-holiday-wreath-lights/) guide. This is a holiday themed Adafruit MagTag project involving a NeoPixel strip and LED animations. This build was similar to a previous project I did using a Circuit Playground Bluefruit, (and even uses the same wreath!) but this time the project is controlled by the MagTag. There are three holiday colored LED animations, each activated by a button. It has a lovely set of instructions on the display showing what animation each of the buttons activates. If you're looking for a quick, easy project to do with your MagTag, check out this guide.

I also began working on a guide that is a new take on Cheerlights. Cheerlights is a project that allows folks to tweet a color, to enable LED projects all over the world to sync to that color. I took it one step further, and instead of simply syncing to that color, the project instead displays a different LED animation in the specified color. It uses the same build as the guide I published this week, and turns Cheerlights into animated holiday fun. Keep an eye out next week for that guide!

This past week I've been working on PWMOut for the i.MX RT series. It's been a while since I worked with the toolchains and boards involved, so spinning back up has been a work in progress. I'll hopefully have more updates on new i.MX features in the coming weeks. 

I also spent some time on implementing the DMA peripheral on the STM32 boards as a side project, but unfortunately had little success. DMA (Direct Memory Access) ranges from beneficial to essential for higher performance projects on the STM32s, but it has been fiddly in practice to get working with other peripherals like SPI, outputting mostly garbage data. I'll be putting it down for now to cool my head but will hopefully revisit at a future date.

**Melissa**

This past week I finished up the Web Serial ESPTool. I got file writing working on the ESP32 and then added ESP32-S2 support as well. I was able to get it writing in pure JavaScript by using a FileReader class which returns the raw bytes of the file. Once I got uploading working consistently, I cleaned up the UI elements to make it match the existing design and only show the controls once it has connected as well as disabling certain controls while the file is being written. It was a fun project and I feel like I learned a lot more about Web Serial. If you're interested in checking it out, you can take a look at [https://adafruit-esptool.glitch.me/](https://adafruit-esptool.glitch.me/).

**Scott**

This last week I've made a number of small fixes to CircuitPython on the ESP32-S2 with the goal of improving stability and fixing network issues. It was a short week due to Thanksgiving.

I've switched gears and am now refining deep sleep under the hood. Deep sleep will usually stop a USB connection. So, if your code deep sleeps when USB is connected, we'll pretend to deep sleep instead. This allows you to watch what happens over the serial connection and also iterate quickly on your code. I'm refining things under the hood to ensure that our pretending works more similar to a real deep sleep.
