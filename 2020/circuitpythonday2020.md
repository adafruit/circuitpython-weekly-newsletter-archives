## Hackerlab Sacramento

Hackerlab in Sacramento, California was planning events for CircuitPython Day, but has been impacted by power cuts in California. They plan to do a follow-up event at a later date.

##  Dedication

On August 4th, 2020, Beirut, Lebanon experienced a massive explosion that left many dead and injured, as well as leaving thousands homeless. 
In the aftermath, Lamba Labs Makerspace stepped up and joined the efforts to rebuild their community, including search and rescue, 
restoring damaged homes, and volunteering, including providing aid tents to help the community find food and shelter and 
joining construction engineers to help with the rebuilding process. Last year, Lamba Labs Makerspace was a partner for CircuitPython Day.
This year CircuitPython Day is being dedicated to Lamba Labs Makerspace for all of the amazing work they're doing in the Beirut community. 
If you would like to help with their efforts, consider donating to the following fundraisers:

* Impact Lebanon fundraiser: http://adafru.it/impactlebanon
* Anera and Global Shapers fundraiser: http://adafru.it/globalshapersbeirut

Details about each fundraiser can be found at the links provided.
