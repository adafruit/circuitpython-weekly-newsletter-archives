Hi everyone! Here is the latest Python for Microcontrollers newsletter brought you by the Python on hardware community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Snake on through to the other side, let's get slinking!

## The many forks & ports of MicroPython

[![Forks](../assets/02182020/21820mpforks.png)](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-micropythons)

[![Forks](../assets/02182020/21820mpforkchart.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-micropythons)

There are many interesting forks and ports of MicroPython and we are going to get them in one place with as much information as possible. This is the [start of the list on GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-micropythons), please add any comments there with ones we've missed, or open an issue/PR to update the list. The goal of this is not to encourage forks, it's a list that has all the forks & ports, for what platforms, latest updates, and if they are open-source.

[![X Chapters](../assets/02182020/21820xchapters.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4360)

Somewhat timely, on our weekly show, we talked about the [counterfeits](https://artofelectronics.net/the-book/counterfeit-editions/) on Amazon of ["The Art of Electronics by Horowitz & Hill"](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2356) - we (Adafruit) purchase the books directly from the publisher (Cambridge Press), and then we see the same book on Amazon cheaper. Some of real, some were counterfeits, but we'll never get the same kill-everyone-else pricing that Amazon does, or the same pricing a counterfeiter can do. We usually are pretty close with the pricing, but sometimes our price is a little more. The good news is (sorta?) is that we have a ton of customers who have been burned by Amazon over the years from counterfeit text books to counterfeit products, so specifically for the Art of Electronics, getting it from Adafruit is the for-sure way to make sure it's the real version. We now have the [X Chapters in stock](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4360) and it's the real one of course.

[![BONSAI BUCKAROO](../assets/02182020/21820buckaroo02.png)](https://youtu.be/I7t4xUanK8U)

The BONSAI BUCKAROO for CLUE & micro:bit. We can’t wait for spring to arrive, and we’re looking forward to caring for some plants! We designed this little add-on for micro:bit or CLUE boards – you just bolt it on with 5 screws to get a buzzer/beeper, motor driver and breakouts for connecting a soil sensor (two alligator clips + nails work just fine), simple, but effective! - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/I7t4xUanK8U).

[Testing out sensor plotting directly on the CLUE display](https://youtu.be/Nz38vF2W8BI). We wrote a plotter/scope for the CLUE in Arduino – you can plot any of the built in sensors (light, temperature, pressure, humidity, color, proximity, accel, gyro, mag) all directly on the 240×240 display. we even added auto-scaling! this makes it really easy to test out the sensors and measure the world around us Code - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Arcada/blob/master/examples/full_board_tests/arcada_clue_sensorplotter/arcada_clue_sensorplotter.ino).

Displaying 9 DoF orientation in a browser using webserial with CLUE. The CLUE board has a 9 DoF motion sensor (accel/gyro/mag) that can be used to calculate orientation (video). It’s hard to visualize using just text. Normally folks would use a Processing sketch to display the 3D model but now that webserial is available in the browser, it’s much easier to use that! This website uses webserial to get the Euler angles & three.js to display a bunny that moves around. We’ll update it to use quaternions next - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Z0IpAMcecHE).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

[![Bryan](../assets/02182020/20200218bryan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week has been a fun time working on a project and guide to make a Sip and Puff device that requires no soldering and very minimal code! I was able to make use of the [Feather STM32F505](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4382) and its built in STEMMA QT connector to easily plug it into an [ST LPS33HW ported pressure sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4414), as well as a STEMMA QT OLED screen to output status and configuration information.

[![Bryan](../assets/02182020/20200218bryan1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Along the way I also learned a lot about Assistive Technology and the plethora of makers helping support it and make it more accessible and even more functional. [ATMakers.org](http://atmakers.org/about-us/) and [Makers Making Change](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/about-us/) are two great organizations that are helping get AT devices based on Open Source Hardware and Software into the hands of folks that need it.

I'm happy to do what I can to contribute and while the sip and puff I was able to put together is one among many, I look forward to contributing wherever I can.

The [Sip and Puff guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/st-lps33-and-circuitpython-sip-and-puff) should be out by now, so head over, take a look, and see how you can use it or one of the many other open source AT projects to make a difference for people that need some assistance in doing things that man of us take for granted.

**Dan**

This week I fixed several of the remaining issues that needed resolution before we release CircuitPython 5.0.0 for general availability. On nRF boards I coded around a hardware bug, so we can now use the fast SPI peripheral. The CLUE board display is now a lot faster. For all builds, I improved the accuracy of the **time** module functions from milliseconds to microseconds.

I helped Dylan and John Park use the BLE bicycle sensor library I wrote last work for a fun project. You'll be seeing the Learn Guide for it soon.

We had a head-scratching bug about why I2C operations were getting slower and slower when used in a loop. I spent a lot of time on this, but it turns out it had nothing to do with I2C *per se*. Instead was due to a particular pattern storage allocations in the **adafruit_bus_device** library. I made the library more efficient, and the issue provoked Scott to make the storage allocator faster

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/02182020/20200218jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I'm going on the road for a couple of weeks and packing just the basics to continue on my work with ulab and JEplayer.

When I'm not sightseeing, I'll be busy with improvements to ulab, a numpy-like package for CircuitPython, and porting JEplayer's UI to the PyPortal Pynt's touchscreen.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Introducing Adafruit CLUE](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-clue) guide. This guide has detailed information about all the features of CLUE with a thorough Pinouts page including images and a fancy edge-connector pinout diagram (courtesy of Andrew Tribble!), as well as setup instructions for both Arduino and CircuitPython.

[![Kattni](../assets/02182020/20200218kattni.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Next, I worked on a series of CLUE demos using the new [CLUE library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CLUE): a height calculator, a spirit level, and a temperature and humidity monitor. I put together a quick guide page for each that will be available soon. They can be found under [CLUE CircuitPython Demos](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-clue/clue-circuitpython-demos) in the Introducing Adafruit CLUE guide. The plan is to extend this series of demos. Next up is a compass demo. After that, who knows! There's so many options with the CLUE, the possibilities are endless!

**Melissa**

This past week I continued working on WebSerial and adapting it to work with the new CLUE for calibrating the IMU sensor. Unfortunately, I kept running into an issue where it seemed to get overwhelmed by too much data and would slow way down, so I will probably be taking a different approach.

In order to gather my thoughts a little better, I switched over to working on Github issues for a few days. I've been focusing mostly on fixing some outstanding display issues and added a couple of new shapes to the Adafruit_CircuitPython_Display_Shapes library. Afterwards, I'll be switching back to working on the CLUE board and IMU sensor again.

**Scott**

Last week I continued work on BroadcastNet. I've started getting PRs out, but everything is still pending. This week I'm working on using a Raspberry Pi 3 as a BroadcastNet bridge, with the hope it will be more reliable than an ESP32 wifi link. I'm very excited to use Ethernet for it.

Over the weekend, I attended PyCascades 2020 and it was great to see a bunch of awesome Pythonistas. I was the last talk and the video of it is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WdjlznbD0o&t=29274

This week so far, I took a detour into memory allocation performance after Ladyada and Dan found something really weird. It was a really tight loop reading accelerometer data and storing it, where the gaps between reads increased from 1 ms to 10 ms and then reset. Turns out it was an un-optimized allocation case which I've now optimized as well. So, check out the last builds and let us know how it's (hopefully) improved performance for you.

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
