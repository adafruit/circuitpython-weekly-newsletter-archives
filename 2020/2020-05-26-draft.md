## Automate testing in multiple Python environments with Nox

[![Nox](../assets/20200526/20200526nox.jpg)](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/)

Nox is an open source commandline tool that automates testing in multiple Python environments, similar to [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.org/). Unlike tox, Nox uses a standard Python file for configuration. For each session, Nox will automatically create virtualenv with the appropriate interpreter, install the specified dependencies, and run the commands in order - [Website](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/), [Tutorial](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/tutorial.html) and [GitHub](https://github.com/theacodes/nox).

A new version was released on May 24th - [Changelog](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/CHANGELOG.html).

## A CircuitPython Altitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) Library

[![AHRS](../assets/20200526/20200526ahrs.jpg)](https://github.com/gamblor21/Gamblor21_CircuitPython_AHRS/wiki)

Mark Komus has contributed a CircuitPython library to perform Altitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) calculations. AHRS takes an accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer and combine the data to create orientation data. While previous implementations had been in Arduino ([Adafruit Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_AHRS)), this one is written in CircuitPython for fast microcontrollers.

Be sure to get the latest [CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle) to get the library - [Documentation](https://github.com/gamblor21/Gamblor21_CircuitPython_AHRS/wiki).

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep an eye out here for updated download stats coming soon!

## Whatâ€™s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in!

I've started to work on using the [bleak](https://pypi.org/project/bleak/) Python library for to implement [\_bleio](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/_bleio/index.html) on host computers, analogous to how [Blinka](https://pypi.org/project/Adafruit-Blinka/) emulates native CircuitPython on host computers. Bleak uses Python [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), which complicates how it can be called from regular synchronous CircuitPython code. I'm studying up on asyncio and a number of helper libraries.

It was a long time coming, but the guide was finally published for the PyGamer MP3 Player, affectionately known as JEplayer.  CircuitPython has been able to play MP3s since the release of version 5, but somehow we never released a guide about it.

JEplayer is a bit complex, so it's fortunate that another guide was published this week for MP3s on CircuitPython (and arduino!) that is more tutorial oriented: "Daily Cheer Automaton".  Check that guide out too if you want to add MP3 playback to your CircuitPython projects without the need for a special MP3 decoding chip.

This week, I've been working with LED animations using the Adafruit CircuitPython LED Animation library. The library is designed to make displaying LED animations super simple, from blinking, to sparkles, to comets and more. Between pixel mapping and animation groups working with pixels in a matrix or other shape, or multiple groups of pixels, like two connected matrices, is a breeze.

Initial testing showed that the way the library was written made it of limited use on the SAMD21 M0 boards, which includes the ubiquitous Circuit Playground Express. So, over the weekend, we worked on a complete refactor of the library to split every animation into its own module making it significantly more modular. The changes were successful - it's at least possible to run all but one of the animations individually on the CPX. Further testing is necessary to determine all of the limitations, but it's much better than it was. We now have a solid API and all additions moving forward will follow it.

Now I am working on an LED animations guide that covers many of the features of the LED Animation library. The guide covers how to use the library overall, the basic, sparkle and rainbow animations, and using the pixel mapping and grouping helpers. It'll include a link to the API documentation in case you want to take it further.

Along the way I am finding a few bugs and things we missed during the refactor, which is always an added bonus of having the opportunity to test something thoroughly.

This past week I've been working on the internals of pin management and BusIO on the i.MX chips, whittling away at the issues list on Github. The i.MX had some tricky aspects to this - the SDK for the chip doesn't really have an appropriate "reset pin" function, so keeping resets states consistent with startup required storing in the default states of each pin from the datasheet so they could be restored on reset. I've been working on other miscellaneous improvements to the i.MX Busio module, and reading about the timer peripherals in anticipation of implementing Pulsio.

Over the weekend, I took some time to work on a personal project of mine, support for a type of motor called the [Dynamixel](http://www.robotis.us/dynamixel/). I've been big fan of these motors ever since I used them back in college - they're easy to manage for more complicated robotics projects and have a lot of built in "checks" to keep them from breaking under stress. I've put together a [circuitpython library](https://github.com/hierophect/Circuitpython_Dynamixel) for using the motor (a bit unpolished at the moment) which I'm hoping to submit to the community bundle next week.

To test it out, I tried it on a simple robot I'm calling Hermie (for hermit crab). It's not too sophisticated yet... but we'll see where it goes.

This week I finished up a couple of small projects including adding an uninstall option for the Script that installs PiTFT drivers on the Raspberry Pi. Some of the guides warn the user that they must not have Kernel Level drivers in order to use displays with the Raspberry Pi, but there wasn't actually a guide that told them how to do it. Now they can easily do it by choosing an uninstall option.

One of the reasons for adding this option was to lay the groundwork for adding displayio to Blinka so that displayio scripts can be run on the Raspberry Pi. It ended up being a bigger project than I initially thought, but I've been working my way through it. Hopefully I'll have something more concrete to show off next week.

At the end of last week I polished up the initial ESP32S2 CircuitPython work - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUkCUbYsgc8) Early this week it was merged in! I quickly followed that up with a PR to finish up `digitalio`. It's ready to merge so it'll be in shortly.

Next, up is `busio` which includes I2C, SPI and UART support. This one module is used to support most of the sensors sold by Adafruit and will unlock many projects.
