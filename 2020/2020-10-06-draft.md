## Join the Python Developers Survey 2020

[![Python Developers Survey 2020](../assets/20201005/20201005psf.jpg)](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/10/join-python-developers-survey-2020.html)

This year, the Python Software Foundation is conducting the fourth iteration of the official Python Developers Survey. The goal is to capture the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year’s, they can identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community and the key insights into it.

In 2019, more than 24,000 Python users from 150 countries participated and shared how they use the language.

Contribute to the community’s knowledge. The survey takes about 10 minutes to complete - [Python Blog](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/10/join-python-developers-survey-2020.html).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20201005/blinka.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **273**!

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep checking back for updated download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

I just wrapped up my work on the [CircuitPython library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP2515) for the MCP2515 CANbus controller. It was fun to work with and I enjoyed collaborating with Jeff to determine the API that the `canio` devices will use. This work will make it so that code written for one CAN controller, like those included with the SAM-E51 will be usable with another CAN controller, such as the venerable MCP2515.

Next up, I’m working on a sweet little 12-bit ADC, the TLA2024, before looping back to do some additional real-world tests with the CAN hardware and libraries.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20201005/20201005jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

For info about what I've been up to with CAN bus, check out Bryan's report.  I want to spotlight a contribution from github user @mdroberts1243, who has added support for the FeatherWing SH1107 128x64 OLED display.  It will be great to have these displays be compatible with CircuitPython starting with beta.1.  Thanks, Mark!  I have one one of these displays that I hope to include in a project soon.

**Kattni**

I'm back after being out for two weeks, so there's not much to report this week. Published a guide for the QT Py. Many of these were purchased before the guide was written, so if you got your QT Py, but aren't sure where to begin, check out the guide to get started. I updated the guide for the TSL2591 to include the STEMMA QT version. I wrote up a quick guide for the LTC4311 with pinouts and downloads resources. I'm now working on a guide for the MIDI FeatherWing, so keep an eye out for that.

**Melissa**

This past week I've been quite busy. It started off with writing a [guide for the new MatrixPortal board](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-m4), which turned out quite well.

[![Melissa](../assets/20201005/20201005melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I finished up the Python version of the PiTFT installer script and learned enough of the Click library to add some automation flags so that the script could be completely automated with a single command and no other user input. For complex installations with boards like the new BrainCraft Hat, this makes a huge difference. One of the big advantages of this is that we can customize the install command for each display and the user can run it without worrying about selecting the wrong options.

[![Melissa](../assets/20201005/20201005melissa1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Finally, the Jetson Nano has been updated to include easily enabling SPI since I wrote a guide for it. So I went through and did a refresh of the guide to make it so it is up to date including how to enable SPI. I also [added a page on SPI](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-libraries-on-linux-and-the-nvidia-jetson-nano) including TFT usage and using NeoPixels with SPI. With the recent improvements, this is now one of my favorite boards that supports Blinka.

**Scott**

Since last week, I've finished fixing Requests for now. Seems to recover from errors well enough. Plus, I burnt myself out a bit on working on networking so a break is welcome.

Later last week I continued to polish up UF2 for the ESP32-S2. I got release assets attached to releases. The last thing I need to do is write up a guide on how to add UF2 support to new boards and install it on them.

Most of this week though has been fixing software issues for two new Metros for two different platforms. Metros are the best form factor to start with because they have the debug connection for easy debugging. I'm excited to see new boards coming!

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
