Happy November! It's the latest Python for Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's dig in!

## The new Raspberry Pi 400 Computer released

[![Raspberry Pi 400](../assets/20201103/20201103keyboard.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4796)

The Raspberry Pi Foundation yesterday announced the new Raspberry Pi 400 Desktop Computer. It's all built into the keyboard! And all the ports come out the back. 

This is such a great Python/CircuitPython machine (just add [Blinka](https://circuitpython.org/blinka/raspberry_pi_4b/)) plus it has all the GPIO pins for hacking.

## ulab 1.0.0 released

[![ulab](../assets/20201103/20201103ulab.jpg)](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/)

Version 1.0.0 of the ulab numerical library is now available. ulab provides numerical capabilities similar to the numpy library but ulab is usable on the limited resources on microcontrollers. This release implements a number of missing features, like higher-dimensional tensors, proper views of arrays, and broadcasting. In addition, a bunch of new functions have been added, as well as customisation options.

The author writes:

> With the help of adafruit-sponsored people (they are credited on the front page of the PDF version of the manual), I have also updated the manual, added a reference section, and a chapter on how ulab can be extended and how new function can be implemented.

> "...when I gave CircuitPython a shot, it was amazing. Along with Mu, the simple Python text editor, I was up and running in no time. Mu recognized that I was using CircuitPython, and once I enabled serial communication to help me find the stupid syntax errors I often make, I was up and running. I hadn’t bought into the “not compiling saves time” argument of Python over C++ for microcontrollers, (especially given the lightweight programming I do) but it does turn out to be a nice feature to click save and watch my screen update."

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

I've been testing new prototypes and doing maintenance on existing libraries. I should have hardware to test another revision of the CAN FeatherWing by the time this gets to you; we're moving to a new controller that is in essence a 2515 with an integrated transceiver in a smaller package!

It's not uncommon to see multiple versions of an IC in different packages, sometimes integrated with associated components to make manufacturing a bit simpler. A great, and a bit unique, example of this is the case of some of Trinamic's excellent stepper drivers; The TMC2209 is a controller with a great feature set that includes useful stuff like current-based stall prevention that enables sensorless homing on 3D printers. This and more is packed into a diminutive QFN package. 

You may have recently [EYE on NPI](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/06/18/eye-on-npi-tmc2226-sa-ultra-silent-stepper-motor-driver-eyeonnpi-digikey-adafruit-digikey-adafruit-trinamic_mc/) where ladyada looked at Trinamic's new TMC2226 that has a lot of the features of the TMC2209 in a TSSOP package. In fact, it has all the features of the TMC2209 because it's the same guts in a new package. The larger TSSOP package has the advantage of a larger thermal pad for heat dissipation, as well as being easier to inspect by eye thanks to having external pins.


**Dan**

More, more BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)!

I finished up the [CircuitPython BLE Libraries on Any Computer](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-ble-libraries-on-any-computer) guide, which shows how to use the adafruit-blinka library to run CircuitPython BLE code and libraries on Windows, MacOS, and Linux (including Raspberry Pi).

And, I've added a longish shared [guide page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-airlift-breakout/circuitpython-ble) to all the AirLift board product pages describing how to use the ESP32 AirLift co-processor in BLE mode, instead of its usual WiFi mode. You can now use other BLE devices to talk to AirLift-equipped accessory or development boards, such as the AirLift FeatherWing, the Metro M4 AirLift Lite, or the new MatrixPortal board.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20201103/20201103jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Following up on adding canio to the ESP32-S2, it's another project with the ESP32-S2!  I'm investigating support for AudioOut and I2SOut.  Both peripherals are available in the microcontroller, but I have to write the core code to make it all work.  I've switched from the Kaluga devkit to the new Adafruit Metro ESP32-S2 Express.  So far it's all a work in progress, but maybe horrible distorted noises will come out of a speaker soon!luc

**Kattni**

The [QT Py Activity Timer and Hydration Reminder](https://learn.adafruit.com/qt-py-activity-timer-and-hydration-reminder) guide was published. If you're the type of person who gets hyperfocused and forgets to take breaks or eat lunch, or you want a periodic reminder to stay hydrated, check out this guide. It's a compact little LED ring sandwich that sits on your desk, with entirely customisable code. The guide covers assembly and how to customise the code to fit your needs.

I also added a Pinouts page to the existing Braincraft HAT guide. If you picked up one of these HATs and wanted the details about what's on it, check out this update.

Along with that, I published the [Adafruit Voice Bonnet](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-voice-bonnet) guide. The Voice Bonnet adds two mics and speakers to your Raspberry Pi. Everything you need to know, and details on getting up and running with it is available in this guide. 

**Lucian**

These past few weeks I've been taking some time off, working on an accumulation of life issues and some of my own projects. Some of it has been CPy related despite being off the clock, such as an SPI Peripheral module I need for a tracking system, and a new teeny Circuitpython enabled dev board I whipped together with JLCPCB:

[![Lucian](../assets/20201103/20201103lucian.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Now that I'm back, I'm switching over briefly to Arduino, to implement some of the improvements we made to the Neopixel on ESP32-S2 Circuitpython. The Neopixel libraries on Arduino don't yet use the ESP32's RMT module (ReMoTe controller module), which is usually used for IR but is also capable of emulating high speed protocols like the Neopixel's. I'm also reading up on the ESP32-S2 network layers so I can better assist Scott with those kinds of projects.

**Melissa**

This past week has mostly been about e-ink displays. I've been working on updating a the e-ink breakouts guide to be a more all inclusive guide. I started with adding our new 2.9" Grayscale e-ink display, which required ensuring the software support was in place, so there were a lot of arduino library updates. 

I also added a number of 2.9" Tri-Color e-Ink display pages to [the same guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-eink-display-breakouts). Some of the changes that were made to examples were coming up with a common pinout for wiring up the breakouts so that the user only needed to make only minimal changes to the examples to use them with the FeatherWings and Breakouts. This was a different approach than the old examples which had the wiring chosen to make the wiring diagrams clearer. 

**Scott**

This last week has been a bit scattered. I finished up the native work in CircuitPython to support grayscale e-paper displays. I made a bit of progress on the deep sleep API before getting distracted by adding NTP support for the ESP32-S2 and fixing some bugs in latest version of Adafruit requests.

I'm going to continue fixing requests bugs, wrapping up NTP and hopefully get back to the deep sleep API. It's all worthwhile work so the only cost is switching between the different tasks. It will be great to get it all polished up. :-)
