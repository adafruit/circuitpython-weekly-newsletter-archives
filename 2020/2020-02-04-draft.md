## CircuitPython and Feather power wheelchair as an Xbox controller

[![Freedom Wing Adapter](../assets/02042020/2420freedom.gif)](https://youtu.be/FgKNWc-EpHQ)

Freedom Wing Adapter – Adapter allows power wheelchairs to control Xbox - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/FgKNWc-EpHQ):

>_"Introducing The Freedom Wing Adapter! In partnership with AT Makers, together we’ve created the first of its kind adapter to enable a player using a power wheelchair to control an Xbox. And we’re going to release it to the world for free. The AbleGamers Charity creates opportunities that enable play, in order to combat social isolation, foster inclusive communities, and improve the quality of life for people with disabilities."_

## Get a CLUE!

[![CLUE](../assets/02042020/2420clue01.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/clue)

[![CLUE](../assets/02042020/2420clue02.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/clue)

The micro:bit shaped, CircuitPython-powered, sensor-packed CLUE is shipping! We wanted to build some projects that have a small screen and a lot of sensors. To make it compatible with existing projects, we made it the same shape and size as the BBC micro:bit and with the same edge-connector on the bottom with 5 big pads so it will fit into your existing robot kit or 'bit add-on. This is the alpha release of the hardware. This is the alpha release of the hardware, everything works, but we may change around the sensors or pinouts as we add projects and support for the CLUE! 

While the CLUE looks a bit like a 'bit it has totally redesigned-from-scratch technology:

 * Nordic nRF52840 Bluetooth LE processor - 1 MB of Flash, 256KB RAM, 64 MHz Cortex M4 processor
 * 1.3″ 240×240 Color IPS TFT display for high resolution text and graphics
 * Power it from any 3-6V battery source (internal regulator and protection diodes)
 * Two A / B user buttons and one reset button
 * Tons of sensors!
 * ST Micro series 9-DoF motion - LSM6DS33 Accel/Gyro + LIS3MDL magnetometer
 * APDS9960 Proximity, Light, Color, and Gesture Sensor
 * PDM Microphone sound sensor
 * SHT Humidity
 * BMP280 temperature and barometric pressure/altitude
 * RGB NeoPixel indicator LED
 * 2 MB internal flash storage for datalogging, images, fonts or CircuitPython code
 * Buzzer/speaker for playing tones and beeps
 * Two bright white LEDs in front for illumination / color sensing.
 * Qwiic / STEMMA QT connector for adding more sensors, motor controllers, or displays over I2C. You can plug in GROVE I2C sensors by using an adapter cable.
 * Programmable with CircuitPython

The CLUE is designed for projects that use a ton of sensors - and they're all built in! So you can start exploring your world, measuring, logging and learning. You can transmit data over Bluetooth to a computer or mobile device for data plotting and logging, or save it to the built in storage - [adafruit.com/clue](https://www.adafruit.com/clue) & [MAKE coverage](https://makezine.com/2020/01/31/adafruit-clue-a-microbit-form-factor-smorgasbord/).

The latest newsletter: [Inside Excamera Labs by jamesbowman](https://tinyletter.com/jamesbowman) -

>_"ever since Gameduino 1, the most common feedback is that they are hard to program. Sure, a minority of programmers who specialize in graphics and are willing to devote time and energy to a graphical application can get good results. But what about people who only want a menu system, or a temperature display, or a photo frame, or show a kid how to make pong? All those people want to write a minimum of code, get the satisfaction of something that looks good, and move on.  And CircuitPython is part of that. It's much more beginner-friendly than the Arduino environment. It's just easier to use."_

Testing out orientation calculation for Feather Bluefruit Sense - Last week we did a couple guides on calibrating sensors. This week we're taking that calibrated data and putting it through some filters to create orientation data. We're using PJRC's orientation visualizer which is an easy way to see which way the board is oriented - nice and stable. It's board 107 on [circuitpython.org/downloads](https://circuitpython.org/board/feather_bluefruit_sense/)

[![WebSerial](../assets/02042020/2420webserial.gif)](https://youtu.be/AKfWKBS1S08)

Trying out a pure-javascript WebSerial Plotter in Chrome. The Chrome browser supports WebSerial – that means you can get serial port data fast and easy into a webbrowser – easier than WebUSB! So of course Melissa whipped up a great little plotter/monitor that you can use to display incoming data from an Arduino, Circuitpython, whatever microcontroller! Works great, we’re still working on features and performance but you can try sending it CSV data here - [Glitch](https://adafruit-webserial-plotter.glitch.me/), and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/AKfWKBS1S08).

We’re liking the combo of the LIS3MDL + LSM6DSOX for a high quality 9-DoF IMU set. The DSOX has great gyro performance, so it’s excellent for AHRS/orientation calculation. Here’s a FeatherWing and StemmaQT breakout version!

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **209**!

## What's the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let's check in!

**Bryan**  
This week I wrote drivers for the DPS310 Precision Pressure sensor and the APDS9500 gesture sensor.  

The DPS10 is a neat litle sensor that comes calibrated from the factory which allows it to be especially accurate. The downside to this is that the diver is considerably more complicated than the average pressure sensor because the calibration values have to be extracted and then applied to every measurement using a non-trivial formula that even accounts for the temperature!. Fortunately this work has been done for you and you can simply use the fruits of my labor!  

The APDS9500 is a neat gesture sensor that has the smarts to detect gestures like up, down, left, or right with minimal software support. Think of the possibilities!  

In other news I did some refactoring of some of the recent arduino libraries to add them to the Adafruit SensorLab library. This helper library makes working with sensors easier by automatically detecting a range of sensors and then using them for calculations. By using this approach we can write sensor sketches that work for any sensor that has a compatible library.

I have been trying out different BLE devices to get them to talk to CircuitPython. The armband above is a heart rate monitor. I wrote a [library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE_Heart_Rate) to communicate with it and similar devices, and John Park is now working on a project and Learn Guide.  

Some of these devices use standard BLE services to communicate, and some use proprietary services. Often we don't know until we try them. Sometimes we can reverse-engineer the proprietary ones.. Sometimes it's not worth it or not possible, and it's easier to find another device that does the same thing but has a friendlier interface.  

I'm also fixing some CircuitPython hangs that occur when you disconnect and reconnect quickly to some of these devices.  

**Jeff**  
This week I continued to fix small bugs in JEplayer, made an improvement to samd51 stereo audio in the core, and contributed a few other small Pull Requests in CircuitPython core and libraries.

**Kattni**  
This week I published the guide for the [Adafruit MLX90640 IR Thermal Camera](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mlx90640-ir-thermal-camera). It includes all the basic info including an Overview and Pinouts, and basic serial print examples to get started. As an added bonus, it also includes Arduino and CircuitPython examples using PyBadge or PyGamer to make an easy to assemble thermal camera with display. Check it out if you're interested in the basics or looking to make a fancy thermal camera! I've started working on the guide for the DPS310 Barometric Pressure Sensor - the CircuitPython library is currently being worked on, so keep an eye out for that and the guide. I have been helping a community member who recently started contributing to CircuitPython with getting into reviewing GitHub pull requests on the CircuitPython libraries, and I want to give a huge hug report to @FoamyGuy for joining the CircuitPythonLibrarians review team and jumping into reviewing. We're starting to get through the PRs that have been sitting for too long - if you submitted a PR to the CircuitPython libraries, expect to see some activity on those as we work through testing and merging what we can. If you're interested in contributing to CircuitPython, but don't know how to get started, reviewing is a great way to do just that. Feel free to ping me on Discord or GitHub (@kattni) if you have any questions.

This week I worked on ironing out the Meowbit. The board has been something of a stress test for the STM32 port overall, exposing circumstantial bugs in PWMOut and DisplayIO, and kickstarting the UF2 bootloader for the port. It's also been a fun opportunity to work more with python, which I haven't done much direct work in. Porting Deshipu's snake project to the board was a fun side project, and looks pretty cute in practice.  

I also worked on the pin profiles for the Espruinos, which I hope to add shortly after the Meowbit is merged, and tested the STM32 bootloader on the Feather F405 and Discovery F412. I'll be working more on those projects this week.  

**Melissa**

This week I finally finished up with updating the Adafruit LED Backpack guide. Each of the 8 boards was almost a guide in itself and you can check out the [guide here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-led-backpack). After that, I started working on a WebSerial plotter to be able to plot data from boards such as the Circuit Playground Express or an Arduino. Currently you can show the raw output from boards, see the data output in a plot, and send commands.

**Scott**  
This week I've wrapped up the pull request with Teensy 4.0 support. So stay tune for the first official (but very alpha) builds on circuitpython.org. I've also reworked PixelBuf just a bit and the PR is very close to being merged. It is one of the last things to get merged before we release 5.0.0. I've also started thinking about sending sensor measurements over Bluetooth Low Energy. There are two parts to this, one is sending the info at high speed over the BLE connection and the other is low speed, infrequent measurements over BLE advertisements. It'll be my first experience with Adafruit IO so I'm excited to dive in.
