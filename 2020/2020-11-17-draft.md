## Whatâ€™s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in!

**Bryan**

This week I was able to quickly jam out the TMP117 driver for Arduino which means next up is working on the product guide for said TMP117. Guides are an integral part of the Adafruit product release workflow since they're how we communicate to customers all the hard work that we've done to take a bare sensor and make it usable by mere mortals. A lot of work goes on behind the scenes to develop a new product and get it ready for release. 

As anyone who has worked on a product of some manner can tell you, be it a sensor breakout, a super sweet sweat-resistant sweater, or an ÃœberWidget 9000, "making" the thing is only the first step to delivering a product to customers. There is a _lot_ of other stuff that differentiates a _thing_ from a _product_, including packaging, shipping, marketing, assembly, quality assurance, support among others. _Sure_, the widget is made of $4 in parts, but that $4 won't get those parts assembled, not to mention getting those parts _to you_ to be assembled. Forget about testing and the _accoutremont_ needed to actually use the widget.

Most people wouldn't be happy if they ordered eggs for breakfast only to be told that they can be found in the fridge in their shells. People complain when they get their eggs over-easy instead of over-medium, so you can imagine how well uncooked, cold eggs in the other room would go over. When one goes to a restraunt for breakfast, at least in the US, they rightfully expect those eggs to be cooked, still warm, and delivered to them on a plate. The same thing applies to other things that you give money to someone for; customers expect their widgets to be assembled and tested, packaged and in their posession by one means or another. All of those "extras" take time and money which means that the cost to provide them either comes from the customer or the business loses money. Alternatively you can find sellers that will take your money for something closer to luke warm eggs that have been sitting on the back of the grill for half a day, "saving" you a few bucks and skipping an unknown number of those extras.

Gary Ray of Black Diamond Games, my Friendly Local Game Store, has written on the topic using a [$1 can of Coke](http://blackdiamondgames.blogspot.com/2008/08/one-dollar-coke.html) to explain where margins go. Most people don't run businesses and don't know what goes into running them, so it's not surprising that most people [have no idea how much money businesses make per item sold](http://blackdiamondgames.blogspot.com/2015/04/profit-margins-tradecraft.html).

As I write this on Wednesday evening, I am finishing up the latest CircuitPython Release Candidate, 6.0.0-rc.2. It has a couple of useful fixes. It's getting to be later in the week, so we'll run with another release candidate, and try to release the final 6.0.0 version early next week. A major release generates a lot of support questions, and potentially the need for some quick fixes. So we try to make significant releases early in the week, avoiding the need to handle support issues on the weekend.

I am now working on light sleep and deep sleep in CircuitPython, after significant work by Scott and @microDev.  We are working on a general sleep API for all ports, but our first implementation will be for the ESP32-S2 boards. You'll be able to wake up either after a time interval or when a signal appears on one or more pins. For light sleep, your program will continue; for deep sleep, your program will restart, but you'll be able to find out what caused it to wake up.

When your program is sleeping, it can use much less power. In the case of deep sleep, this can be many orders of magnitude (hundreds of milliamperes to tens of microamperes).

It's alive!  After returning to the project to add I2S Audio Output to the ESP32S2, I have correct looking waveforms coming out of the I/O pins.  More work is needed in order to actually transmit the correct audio data, but this is a big milestone in a task that's proving tougher than I initially expected.  This screenshot shows a capture from the ESP32S2 Kaluga board to a saleae logic analyzer.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Adafruit MagTag](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-magtag) guide, and did everything that goes with that. It has a detailed Pinouts page that takes you on a tour of your new MagTag board. It also shows you how to get started with CircuitPython, and includes resource downloads. If you received your MagTag and are wondering what it's capable of and how to get started, check out this guide.

When we release new products, we put the PCB files up on GitHub because everything we do is Open Source. We have a standard format for those repositories, and a cookiecutter setup to do the work for us on creation. It is currently designed to make a local copy using git, so all you have to do is update the readme and then push the board files to GitHub. Git defaults to using the master branch as the default branch. The Adafruit GitHub is now set to default to main as the default branch on new repositories. This caused me some confusion when attempting to upload the MagTag board files to GitHub. So I updated the cookiecutter setup and put in a PR to have the local copy default to main as well.

**Lucian**

This week I've been working on the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) send and receive on the ESP32-S2, which is a Transport-Layer protocol in the Internet Protocol Suite comparable to TCP. Compared to TCP, UDP is "connectionless" and doesn't have any handshaking, which means it's fast but unreliable. This makes it good for projects where you don't care if some of your messages get lost, like grabbing the atomic time from global servers, or transmitting voice and gaming data where speed is more important than accuracy.

I've also been working on a project that adds SPI peripheral capabilities to Circuitpython, letting a Circuitpython board respond appropriately to a SPI host device that is issuing periodic commands. It's a bit niche, but I'll be using it with some tracking tech that might be good for robotics teleoperation projects.

**Melissa**

This past week I finished up writing the guide for the 128x128 Grayscale OLED. This covers using it in both Arduino and CircuitPython and includes lots of wiring diagrams. It had a few differences over the previous OLEDs such as defaulting to 0x3D for the address. You can check out [the guide here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-grayscale-1-5-128x128-oled-display).

I also started writing a library for the MagTag display. This library will have similar elements to the MatrixPortal library and be structured in a similar manner. I have been running into a few challenges related to the ESP32-S2 processor being so new including accidentally losing all of my files which I had fortunately backed up first. I'll post an update once that library is released.

**Scott**

This week I've been running down grayscale EInk and ESP32-S2 bugs. Last week, Melissa and I released improved versions of ESP32SPI and Requests libraries that seem to be working better for folks. Early this week I found and fixed the disparity between the grays in CircuitPython compared to Arduino. Lastly, I added the EInk as a native display for the MagTag and debugged an issue with the luma computation used to convert color images to grayscale. I'm continuing to bug hunt at the end of this week with focus on the ESP32-S2's networking.
