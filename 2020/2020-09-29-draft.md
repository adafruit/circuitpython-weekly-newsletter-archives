## A CircuitPython Music Visualizer

[![CircuitPython Music Visualizer](../assets/20200929/20200929fft.jpg)](https://steam-tokyo.com/making-circuitpython-music-visualizer/)

A CircuitPython-based music and sound visualizer, built using the [Adafruit CLUE board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500). The onboard microphone captures the ambient sound and the CLUE provides a visual representation of the frequencies it detects on the color display. The ulab library, similar to numpy, provides the fast fourier transform function which takes the sound data and provides the frequencies to display.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

[![Bryan](../assets/20200929/20200929bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The BNO08x libraries for CircuitPython and Arduino are released, both for the full SHTP based interface as well as libraries to use the super-neat **UART-RVC** interface. Along with them the guide has been mostly finished, and with four associated libraries as well as 3 and a half different transports, it’s my largest guide to date except for, possibly, my first which included an inordinate number of animated gifs. I always say this and it’s always genuine but I am _really_ excited to see what folks do with these libraries and the BNO08x sensors. There are many applications that I can think of, just off the top of my noggin: 

**Head tracking for VR applications:** This sensor specifically targets this use case and includes several report types and fusion products to optimize for that application. I’d like to see BNO08x support added to the [Relativity project](https://github.com/relativty/Relativty) but it’d have to be someone with more free time than me! I can also imagine IMUs and autopilots or AHRS systems for model airplanes, novel input devices and even musical instruments. I’ll be honestly sad if I don’t see a little glass cockpit for RC planes come out of this.

With the BNO08x libraries (and soon breakouts) shipped, I’m back to CAN land, currently implementing a (Circuit)Python library to complement the `canio` module that Jepler is adding to the CP core for MCUs that support it. Once we get a stable foundation for the basics on the platforms we target, we can then start thinking about supporting features for [higher level protocols](http://www.copperhilltechnologies.com/can-bus-guide-higher-layer-protocols/) that will enable things like car hacking and more robust sensor networks.

**Jeff**

My new "canio" module with support for the SAM E51 and E54 was merged to CircuitPython. The code has been validated by exchanging packets between the E5x microcontrollers and STM32F405 microcontrollers running Micropython. I also snooped the CAN bus in my car. It missed the 6.0.0-beta.0 release, but it will be a part of the next beta.  A Feather with CAN support is in the works, but if you're eager (maybe you want to start creating an OBD-II library?) you can check it out now with the SAM E54 Xplained board from Microchip.

**Lucian**

This week I finished investigating the bugs occurring on the RGBMatrix, which turned out to mostly be from a single, minor issue in the Learn guide! It's funny when one small mixup in something like the documentation can result in an error being compounded across multiple systems until it looks like some monstrous, mysterious bug, when in fact the software is fine. There was a legitimate crash hidden in there too, though, so it's good that we revisited the issue in detail. 

I've also started up work on the AnalogIO functionality for the ESP32, and had a good discussion with Scott about module priorities after that. Getting the basics done for the ESP32 series is the highest priority for now, since those chips are so capable, but I'm still excited for things that might be a little further down the pipeline, like enabling the crypto modules and camera functions of the STM32 series. There are a lot of interesting chips coming out from Espressif and ST in the near future, so it's been fun to think about what can be done with the next generation of smaller, faster, and even more capable SoCs. 

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on writing a guide for the Pixel Framebuf library. You can check it out at https://learn.adafruit.com/easy-neopixel-graphics-with-the-circuitpython-pixel-framebuf-library.

I also wrote another demo for John Park's workshop. Be sure to catch his show each week on Thursdays at 1PM Pacific/4PM Eastern.

I also worked on converting the adafruit-pitft shell script from Bash to Python. I am going to continue working on testing and debugging it before I put it up on github, but it's working well so far. One of the biggest changes are that it has a master configuration that will be much easier to add more boards to so it will be easier to manage.

**Scott**

This week I've been bouncing between adding multiple flash size support to UF2 and fixing bugs in my requests library changes. UF2 is the USB drive bootloader that we've loved on SAMD and nRF and we're now bringing it to the ESP32-S2.

Updating the adafruit_requests library has been a challenge. Networking can error at any time, which means the code needs to handle exceptions in many places. Furthermore, the library works with a number of socket implementations that currently do things a little bit different from each other. CircuitPython is also memory limited so we're trying to do it all while using memory in small pieces, rather than large ones.

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/20200929/codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
