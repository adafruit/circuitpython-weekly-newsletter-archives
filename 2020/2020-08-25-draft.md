**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep checking back for updated download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

The last week has seen me mostly working on the CircuitPython library for the BNO080. It's been an enjoyable process as things have, at least until recently, gone swimmingly. I was able to get packets sent and received over I2C fairly quickly, and not too long after I was able to get quaternion data!

It's a testiment to the utility that CircuitPython can provide to seasoned programmers that I was able to get a relatively complex sensor working so quickly. Iteration times are fast thanks to CircuitPython's auto-reload on write functionality, and when paired with a "watcher" it's nearly as fast as I type! What I'm calling are small programs that run in the background looking for file change events and the do _something_. They're essentially the same as what is powering the CircuitPython auto-reload behavior, however in my case I have them set up to write any changes to the library I'm working on to the lib directory on my CIRCUITPY drive. All of that combined with an editor (VSCode) that auto saves, and I rarely have to wait more than a handful of seconds to see my work.

The development of the BNO080 library will benefit from this as it's a very substantial chip with lots of bells and whistles, which means even in the unlikely event that I don't hit any snags, it's going to take a while to write. I'm looking forward to seeing what fun stuff I can do with the sensor. Perhaps I'll finally start working on that autonomous glider I've been daydreaming about (probably not).

In other news, I got back the latest revision of the CAN Bus Feather Wing from OSH Park, and after a bit of assembly I was able to use a pair of them to get a Metro 328 talking to a feather M4 over a very simple interface. "Talking" is being generous; the Metro sends incrementing numbers and the Feather prints them out. But! It's working! Huzzah!

**Dan**

While finishing up HCI \_bleio work for a pull request that if I turn off the debug logging I created to help monitor the HCI commands and responses, it stops working :( . I'm currently debugging this. Needless to say, bugs that go away when you add print statements to help diagnose them are harder to find. I'm now sending debug information directly to pins and monitoring them with a Saleae. I'm making progress and hope to submit a PR soon.

**Jeff**

I've started researching CAN bus. We'd like to implement it in CircuitPython for the SAM E5x series microcontrollers. So far I'm very much in learning mode, with a small network of STM32F405 Feathers sending and receiving packets using code in MicroPython, which already supports CAN bus on the STM32 family of chipsr.  The smaller boards in the foreground are CAN bus tranceivers, which translate from logic levels to special voltages and back.

[![Jeff](../assets/20200825/20200825jeff1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

CANbus is an interesting protocol, and the way it can reconstruct the digital signal (top two traces) from two analog signals (bottom two traces) is pretty fascinating. CANbus incorporates error detection features absent from simpler protocols like I2C. The Saleae logic analyzer is pretty handy because it provides its own decoder for the CAN protocol.

[![Jeff](../assets/20200825/20200825jeff2.png)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Do you have an application for CAN bus?  Know of hobbyist-level hardware that works with it?  We'd love to hear about it!  Drop us a note on Discord or Twitter.

**Kattni**

Thursday and Friday were mostly creating Fritzing objects. We have so many upcoming products, that we're trying to get ahead on making the Fritzing objects. If you're interested in seeing some sneak peeks, take a look at the Adafruit Fritzing library.

I have one complicated one in progress that required some changes to the component parts, and will require seeing a photo before I can complete it. I put that on hold until I receive the necessary information.

I was finally given time to do a library PR sweep. This is something that is good to do every so often, as sometimes we miss PRs or comments go unnoticed, etc. I went through all the open PRs across all of the library GitHub repos and either commented, merged, delegated or closed every PR that hasn't seen activity in the last few days. I did quite a few on Monday, and on Wednesday the first thing I did was follow up on all the responses I received from the Monday part of the sweep. There are a large number from Wednesday waiting on replies from different folks, so I hope to be fielding that over the next week or so. I also intend to follow up on a few that I will be closing if I don't hear back. 

**Lucian**

This week I wrapped up the PulseOut and PulseIn PRs, and have moved on to working on some bugfixes. I've also received a development board for the STM32F103RE, which will allow me to help test and develop for the F1 port for STM32. 

**Melissa**

This past week I started converting some of our shell scripts to Python scripts. I got the first two done, but I have come to the conclusion that I need to make a library with shell-like functions to make it so I don't repeat some much code as I go along. This will also speed up the conversion process as I'm able to reuse a lot of the functions.

I also worked with Kattni to write an eInk bonnet guide. I worked on the usage page and described ho to use the eInk bonnet on the Raspberry Pi by going over a few examples including how to force dithering for grayscale images. While I was at it, I added grayscale image mode support to the EPD library. You can check out the guide at https://learn.adafruit.com/2-13-in-e-ink-bonnet

I also worked on updating the Sharp Memory display guide that Jeff Epler had started. I mostly did a little light editing and verified everything was working as intended. I also added a section on the steps needed to sett up the Bad Apple demo that you see on the product page. You can check out that guide at: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-sharp-memory-display-breakout

I've continued to make progress on the native wifi APIs. I've added HTTPS support and fixed closing sockets so that memory is freed as needed.

My focus this week has been testing and polishing the Socket class to better handle errors. Networking has a lot of different pieces that can all cause errors so it's a wide variety of errors to cover. I'm making good progress though and hope to have a first version of the code out for review by the end of the week.
