Hi everyone! It's the latest Python for Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## CircuitPython Takes Flight in MS Flight Simulator

[![Custom Flight Controls](../assets/20200818/20200818sim1.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/wallarug/custom-flight-control-column-part-1-f326a8)

[![Custom Flight Controls](../assets/20200818/20200818sim2.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/wallarug/custom-flight-control-column-part-1-f326a8)

Creating a flight controller for Microsoft Flight Simulator using CircuitPython and custom circuits - [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/wallarug/custom-flight-control-column-part-1-f326a8) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wallarug/status/1294613671801323521).

> For many years, I have used and played in Microsoft Flight Simulator X. In anticipation of the upcoming release of the new version - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 - I wanted to ensure I had the best set up ready for flight! I knew that CircuitPython had a gamepad software library that makes your CircuitPython code appear like a Joystick. I had an idea that this could be hacked up (easily) and make to suit my purpose. CircuitPython also makes working with hardware easy.

## The CLUE Cutebot

[![CircuitPython CLUE Cutebot](../assets/20200818/20200818cluebot.jpg)](https://github.com/jisforjt/CircuitPython_CLUE_Cutebot)

CircuitPython-CLUE-Cutebot is a higher-level CircuitPython library to allow Adafruit's CLUE and ElecFreak's micro:bit Smart Cutebot to communicate while maintaining all the functionality of the CLUE, except for touch features - [GitHub](https://github.com/jisforjt/CircuitPython_CLUE_Cutebot) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVEu-UyjuIc&feature=youtu.be).

> I am a teacher of young learns and as such the code was purposefully left simple so I can use it with them. There is also a comment on nearly every line to help explain to my students what each line is doing.

## A 14-segment Internet Display

[![14-segment Internet Display](../assets/20200818/20200818display1.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/news/it-s-the-leaderboard-that-nobody-wants-to-sit-atop-joey-castillo-s-keeping-tabs-on-the-end-of-times-d28c7a986c1b)

A somber scoreboard keeps real-time tabs on COVID-19, and other such adversaries - the big board of death. This project uses 21 custom HT16K33 14-segment display modules driven from an Adafruit Feather M4 Feather, which has 4 I2C buses to drive so many displays. The microcontroller is mated to an Adafruit AirLift FeatherWing to connect to WiFi. Data is collected via JSON format and displayed on the board - [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/it-s-the-leaderboard-that-nobody-wants-to-sit-atop-joey-castillo-s-keeping-tabs-on-the-end-of-times-d28c7a986c1b) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Hacksterio/status/1295085221763842053).

## bip - using Python with IDA

[![bip](../assets/20200818/20200818ida.jpg)](https://github.com/synacktiv/bip/)

Bip is a project aimed to simplify the usage of Python for interacting with IDA. Its main goals are to facilitate the usage of Python in the interactive console of IDA and for writing plugins. In a more general way, the goal is to automate the recurrent task done through the Python API. Bip is also developed for providing a more object oriented, "Python-like" API and real documentation. It includes both the traditional API and the hexrays API - [GitHub](https://github.com/synacktiv/bip/) aand [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brunopujos/status/1294211283546497024?s=11).

## CircuitPython Day is 9-9-2020

[![CircuitPython Day: 9-9-2020](../assets/20200818/20200818cpday.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Adafruit has chosen September 9, 2020 (9/9/2020) as the snakiest day of this year for CircuitPython Day! Much more to come on events and happenings to include a CircuitPython team livestream, collaboration with hardware and software folks, and highlighting all things Python and Python on Hardware.

[![Lamba Labs Makerspace](../assets/20200818/20200818lamba.jpg)](https://twitter.com/LambaLabs)

It was with great sadness that the community saw the devastation of Beirut several days ago. So many residences were heavily damaged. It was a great relief to hear from our 2019 CircuitPython Day partners Lamba Labs Makerspace:

> Things have been quite tough these days, but so far all manageable. We did a roll call yesterday on all our maker communities. Aside from minor injuries and stitches, broken glass, broken window frames (aluminium and wood), and some broken cars, no real harm done. All the love from here in Beirut ❤

Adafruit is dedicating CircuitPython Day 2020 to Labma Labs and supporting NGO fundraising for the city:

– [Impact Lebanon fundraiser](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/lebanon-relief?utm_term=eYbZ2agjM): their focus is rebuilding lost homes, houses, historic landmarks, and affected hospitals.

– [Anera and Global Shapers fundraiser](http://www.anera.org/donate-globalshapers): an NGO which is coordinating with 12 NGOs including Red Cross Lebanon division and Caritas. Their main goal is collecting funds to sustain the affected families until they can financially recover from the explosion.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

Last week saw me wrap up the MS8607 and move onto the CAN Bus feather. Unfortunately as it turns out I made a mistake while ordering the board and it came back from OSH Park just as I had requested it, bugs and all.

I've ordered a new, bug free board and in the meanwhile have switched gears to looking at the BNO080 from Hillcrest Laboratories. This is a sensor closely related to the BNO055 by Bosch Sensortec. In fact the BNO055 and BNO080 share the same hardware and only differ in the sensor fusion algorithms running on them and the company supporting them

From https://www.digikey.com/en/product-highlight/h/hillcrest-labs/bno080-imu

> Due to a unique partnership with Bosch, Hillcrest Labs' is able to base the BNO080/BNO085 on a Bosch sensor (BMF055) running Hillcrest Labs proprietary SH-2 software. The Bosch equivalent is the BNO055. Though both can be used in inertial sensing applications, choose the BNO085 for applications that demand high dynamic accuracy, low latency, and context/event classification. For embedded applications, the BNO080/BNO085 also includes RTOS support.

If you're not familiar with the BNO055, it is very interesting and fairly unique sensor package. Like other high end motion sensors it includes an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, all with three axes for a total of 9 degrees of freedom. Unlike other sensors it also includes a Cortex M0 processor running a sensor fusion algorithm that does the heavy lifting of taking all of the raw sensor data and calculating useful measurements  like absolute orientation and vectors for angular velocity, acceleration, and magnetic field strength.

An interesting difference between the two is the communication protocol that the BNO080 uses to communicate with the host. Communications take place using a packet based protocol that rides on top of the the underlying USART, I2C or SPI transport layer. Writing the support code to handle that should be an interesting challenge.

I now have HCI \_bleio working completely for Nordic UART as a peripheral. This means I can use the Bluefruit LE Connect app to talk to CircuitPython over BLE using an ESP32 co-processor, available on, for example, the M4 Airlift or the PyPortal. It is satisfying to finally see an end-to-end test working after being head down in this code for weeks. I have a little cleanup to do but will be submitting a PR soon.

I've continued working on the Sharp Memory Display PR, which was recently merged. STM32 support for SDIO was also belatedly merged after some neglect. I also did further work to reduce memory usage on M0 boards so that we could add a new Japanese translation of the core.

Over the last week, I've created a number of fritzing objects, some fritzing wiring diagrams, updated a couple of guides, and created the beginnings of a guide for Ladyada to finish up. I also took care of plenty of miscellaneous items I have had on my list, including adding the CircuitPython Library cookiecutter to our Adabot script so the issues and PRs are included in our tracked list.

I created a new role on the Adafruit Discord, at the suggestion of Hierphect (Lucian): PCB Helpers. I invited three community members who have been helping out a ton in the #pcb-design channel already - Hierophect, deshipu, and electronic_harry. If you're interested in PCB design, but have questions about where to get started or how to optimise what you're already working on, feel free to check out the #pcb-design channel and get assistance from the new Helpers.

I spent a couple of hours on Friday working with John Park to learn more about Adobe Premiere, which I use to record the newsletter video recap. I've been meaning to do this for a while. There are parts of the videos that are identical across all of them, and so it makes the most sense to record these sections once, and then create reusable assets for adding to subsequent videos. I put it off for ages, and finally got around to making the time to learn how. Now I just need to find the time to do it...

This past week, I wrestled with the PulseIO module on the ESP32-S2, which ran into some speedbumps related to the internal buffer system on FreeRTOS. In general, I've found that the ESP32-S2 documentation has been high quality, but there are occasional moments where they designed a system to be used at a higher level than what Circuitpython needs - these cases can require wrangling with some highly abstracted internal code. But despite getting briefly bogged down with the IR receiver, I've finally gotten it to start spitting out the required data, and I'm moving on to cleanup and API fixes for the rest of the module.

I've also been looking at some various documentation and website changes, such as fixing the tendency for old APIs to show up first on Google, and reworking the build flags system to be consistent across all ports. I'm also waiting for a new STM32F103 development board to arrive so I can assist with fixing the flash system and getting that port submitted proper.

Over this past week, I finally got the MatrixPortal library merged in and it is now part of the bundle. If you're interested, you can take a look at it over at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MatrixPortal. It has also been used in a project that has a learn guide written. You can check out John Park's On Air sign available at: https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-matrix-automatic-youtube-on-air-sign. I've been working with John Park to write some additional demos using this library, so be sure to catch John Park's Workshop each week to learn more.

Another big project that I have been working on is to try and get the STM32MP1 working with Blinka. I spent some time building a custom Debian image so that installing Blinka on it would be much easier. Although the image currently isn't working, I am working with an engineer on the Digi-Key forums to figure out the issue and then I can resume getting it working.

In the meantime, I'm working on porting the PiTFT installation from a shell script over to Python so that it will be simpler and easier to add new displays and maintain.

I've made a lot of progress this week! I fleshed out the ipaddress module, got ping working and the core of socket needed for TCP working. I'm able to fetch HTTP websites and will be adding HTTPS support soon.

The filesystem bug I was hitting the last few weeks was really slowing me down so I decided to tackle it head on on Monday. It turned out to be simpler to debug and fix than I expected. So, the fix for that is already checked in and it's full speed ahead on the core socket APIs.
