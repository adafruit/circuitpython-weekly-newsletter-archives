2021 is almost here, and with that is the latest Python for Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). What's new:

## CircuitPython 6.0.1 Released

[![CircuitPython 6.0.1](../assets/20201229/20201229release.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases)

CircuitPython 6.0.1, the second 6.0.x stable release, was made available yesterday. This release fixes regressions in BLE and FrequencyIn() that prevent these functions from operating properly. The release also includes a considerable speedup in JSON parsing. Note that the CircuitPython team recommends the latest pre-release for ESP32-S2 based boards such as the MagTag. The stable release is best for SAMD, STM and nRF boards.

See the details on [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases).

## PyCon US 2021 Call for Proposals

[![PyCon US 2021 Call for Proposals](../assets/20201229/20201229pycon.jpg)](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2020/12/pycon-us-2021-call-for-proposals-is-open.html)

PyCon US 2021’s Call for Proposals has officially opened for talks, tutorials, posters, and charlas. 

With the decision to hold PyCon US 2021 virtually, it will be quite a bit different. The plan is to provide a platform for community members to share their knowledge with those attending the event. During this unique year, presenters are asked to pre-record their session and be available online during their sessions to engage with the attendees via chat. This will eliminate the challenges of internet quality, timezones, and logistics of providing a full schedule over multiple days.  

Please make note of the important deadline for submissions: All proposals are due February 12, 2021 - [PyCon US 2021](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2020/12/pycon-us-2021-call-for-proposals-is-open.html)

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This week my time was primarily spent on the LTR390 UV and ambient light sensor from Liteon. This little fellow allows you to take measurements across a wide band of the UV spectrum, from approximately 275nm to 400nm with the bulk of its sensitivity from 300-350nm. This range of the light spectrum includes both UVA which is associated with skin aging, and UVB which is associated with getting a sunburn. Neither is good for your skin and both are associated with various skin cancers due to the damage they do the the DNA in your skin cells. Keeping your skin safe from excessive UV exposure by staying out of the direct sun, wearing sunscreen and sunglasses, and even a wide brimmed hat can help keep you safe. And for Blinka's sake, don't use a tanning bed.

[![Bryan](../assets/20201229/20201229bryan1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

With that said, UV light isn't _all_ bad. It's important to get some exposure to sunlight as UV light is necessary for the production of vitamin D which helps with the absorption of calcium and phosphorus which is required for proper bone development. Owners of reptiles such as bearded dragons provide their scaly little friends with UV light fixtures to keep them from getting floppy bone disease (i's a technical term, look it up).

[![Bryan](../assets/20201229/20201229bryan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

All this is a long way of saying that it can be useful to be able to measure UV light. Most weather sites will report the UV index for various parts of the day, however if you're the DIY type something like the LTR390 will allow you to measure it for yourself.

**Dan**

A few regressions from 5.3.1 were reported in the CircuitPython 6.0.0 release. I have fixed those bugs, which were in _bleio and frequencyio. We are planning for a 6.0.1 release early in the last week of the year.

I've also been working on issues that need to be fixed before we release 6.1.0 as a stable release. Most of the functionality we want is now there, including deep sleep, but we need to clear the issue queue. Scott just finished pin alarms. I'll be revising the Sleep guide to include that new functionality.

**Jeff**

I fixed a couple of problems with displayio rendering that were encountered on the MagTag, including incorrect transparent colors and a crash.

**Kattni**

This week was a short week for me. Around a couple of meetings, I went through all of the MagTag guides and added a warning regarding updating CircuitPython and any necessary libraries. There was a huge refactor of the MagTag library, and folks are running into issues with running project code because they're either missing some libraries, or running older versions with newer versions, etc. This warning links to the definitive library list and the latest version of CircuitPython for the MagTag. In that process, I identified some out of date information in those guides related to the refactor, and contacted the guide authors to get that info fixed up. The MagTag guides should all be good to go within the next couple of days! 

**Lucian**

This past week I worked on refining the ESP32S2 API for the TCP server features, and running tests to confirm they can send and receive data from other machines (like your PC) on a local network. I've also been working to bring the Socket API closer to CPython overall in terms of error behavior, since there are currently some discrepancies that mess up certain libraries. Besides sockets, I'm working on a guide for the MagTag, creating a language learning flashcard program that uses the new PCF fonts for international characters.

**Melissa**

This past week I spent on several different activities. I found and fixed a bug related to text wrapping in the display text library. It took a few attempts to get the fix just right because we kept finding more types of text that were not wrapping correctly.

I also worked on porting over the MatrixPortal library to use PortalBase which went very smoothly. I started working on the PyPortal library as well, but ended up running into stuff where it wasn't quite as modular as I had thought and am currently working on figuring out the best solution.

After that, I worked on closing a bunch of different Blinka related Pull Requests and Issues that I had been putting off, while also working on the WebSerial ESPTool.
