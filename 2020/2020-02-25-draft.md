## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This week I started working with two new sensors. The first is the ST LPS25, the little sister to the LPS33. In the same way that the LPS33HW and LPS35HW are close enough that they're a 'family' of sorts, the LPS25 is a member of the LPS2X family. With that in mind, expect to see more siblings in the future.

I wrote and published the CircuitPython and Arduino libraries for the LPS2X family over the last week. The LPS2X family is _similar_ to the LPS3X, most of the operations are very similar, but they're different enough to need a new library. After finishing the libraries I put together some tester code by making a few small tweaks to the code for the LPS3X tester.

As I write this I'm about half way through the Arduino library for the HTS221 Barometric Pressure and Temperature sensor from...  **ST!** (What can I say, they make all kinds of good sensors). This sensor is an admirable little guy, dutifully doing what humidity sensors do, letting you know if you hair will be frizzy because there is too much water floating around in the air! Or if it's to muggy for your [mogwai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins).

**Dan**

I'm resolving the remaining few issues we have as blockers before CircuitPython 5.0.0 is released for general availability.

I've started investigating BLE-capable thermometers, which are often used for barbecue monitoring or other cooking applications. Unfortunately, all the ones I've encountered use vendor-specific BLE services which we'll need to reverse engineer. There is a standard BLE "Environmental Sensing Service" that includes temperature, including multiple values, but I haven't seen it used.

**Kattni**

This week I worked on adding [Adafruit CLUE](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500) support to the [Adafruit CircuitPython PyBadger](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PyBadger) library. PyBadger is a badge-focused library designed around making it super simple to create a Hello My Name Is name badge, display a customised QR code, or a "business card" with an image, name and email address. Adafruit and Digi-Key are [giving away CLUEs to each attendee at PyCon 2020](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/02/06/get-a-clue-at-pycon-us-from-digi-key-and-adafruit-digikey-adafruit-pycon2020-pycon-circuitpython/), and we wanted to make it easy to quickly create a CLUE badge using CircuitPython. This involved a complete refactor of the library, but resulted in a simpler code structure when using it. Now, you simply import the library, and it automatically detects which supported board you are using, and imports the appropriate features. You no longer need to instantiate the library after importing. To test this, I created a test suite program that utilises every possible feature in the library, with some board detection to include features not applicable to all three boards. The code wasn't pretty, but it made testing all the features of the library with the updates super quick. It also meant I was able to get assistance from Melissa with testing while minimising the amount of effort required on her part - thanks again, Melissa!

PyCon 2020 is right around the corner, and I am beginning preparation. One of the things I want to do is go through all the libraries and identify "Good First Issues" and create labeled GitHub issues for each one. Last year at the PyCon Sprints, we had a huge amount of participation, and we were able to facilitate that by having things for everyone to work on regardless of experience level. While hardware was crucial to this, having a list of issues to work on was equally important, as it gave us a place to point people to help them get started on their own. There are plenty of things that need to be done with the libraries that would be great for a beginner to take on, but we don't have GitHub issues for very many of them, explaining what each of them are. I will be creating a document outlining what I'm looking for in a Good First Issue, and covering what the content of the issue should look like. If you're interested in helping, please ping me, @kattni on GitHub or the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord), and I will be happy to include you in the effort.

**Lucian**

This week I worked on a large container of ibuprofin, courtesy of Influenza A, which knocked me out for almost a week - the flu vaccine this year missed the common strains, and it's a "double barrel" flu season anyway (both B and A), so remember to wash your hands and stay away from coughing people. 

In other news though I've gotten started on the PulseIO module for STM32, following the wrap up of the new Espruino Wifi and Espruino Pico boards, and the addition of the core temperature/voltage module. I'm hoping to get back up to speed this week, with some IR LED testing of the PulseIn and PulseOut modules. 

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/02252020/02252020melissa.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This last week I started by taking a break from WebSerial for a couple of days and focused on reviewing PRs and fixing issues. I picked back up on creating a 3D Model viewer that worked by taking magnetometer data and changing the rotation of a model. This was done using both Euler angles and Quaternions and I added the ability to select between the two, although quaternions is definitely the preferable method.

After that was wrapped up, I moved over to familiarizing myself with WebBluetooth and adapting the web application to be able to display multiple graphs and other pieces of data in a dashboard style interface.

**Scott**

At the end of last week I created an Eddystone BLE library for broadcasting URLs. Keep an eye out for a guide from John Park about it.

After that I continued work on the Raspberry Pi based BroadcastNet bridge. I've been pushing that work out into libraries including a new Adafruit Blinka bleio library which includes basic scanning support on Linux. I'll also be working to wrap up my changes to ESP32SPI as well.

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
