## CircuitPython Day is in one week! September 9th, 2020 (9-9-2020)

[![CircuitPython Day: 9-9-2020](../assets/20200901/20200901cpday.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Adafruit has chosen September 9, 2020 (9/9/2020) as the snakiest day of this year for CircuitPython Day! The day includes a CircuitPython team livestream, collaboration with hardware and software folks, and highlighting all things Python and Python on Hardware.

[![CircuitPython Day Schedule](../assets/20200901/20200901schedule.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-weekly-newsletter/blob/gh-pages/circuitpythonday2020.md)

### Dia CircuitPython

[![CircuitPython Day: 9-9-2020](../assets/20200901/20200901Qblinka.jpg)](https://diacircuitpython.org/)

CircuitPython fans in Central America are planning additional activities.

> Costa Rican artist isabelootag has been commissioned to create a mascot for us for this event, taking into account our roots and culture as Central Americans. You may already know Blinka, the snake mascot Adafruit has chosen for CircuitPython. With his talent he has created us who we are sure will be loved by all. I present to you Quetzalblinka .

See their website (in Spanish) for their planned activities - [DiaCircuitPython.org](https://diacircuitpython.org/).

### Dedication

This year CircuitPython Day is being dedicated to Lamba Labs Makerspace, who are helping during the Beirut disaster.

## The Bornhack Badge

[![2020 BornHack badge](../assets/20200901/20200901badge.jpg)](https://hackaday.com/2020/08/27/hands-on-bornhack-2020-badge-has-9x32-of-bling-fed-by-circuitpython/)

The [BornHack hacker camp](https://hackaday.com/2020/08/24/running-a-successful-hacker-camp-in-a-pandemic-bornhack-2020/) still happened this year and they once again provided an electronic badge to all attendees - the [2020 BornHack badge](https://github.com/bornhack/badge2020)!

> Similar to the last couple of years, this badge has an ARM cortex M0+ as the main controller, but on this badge it's the SAMD21 from Microchip, with 4 times as much flash and RAM compared to the chips from the previous badges. This makes it possible to run Adafruit CircuitPython, which lowers the bar for how easy it is to get started hacking on the badge.

## The tiny book touch

[![tiny book touch](../assets/20200901/20200901touch.gif)](https://twitter.com/josecastillo/status/1299369843695722496)

Joey Castillo posts a Twitter thread about his development of the tiny book touch, a small epaper reader with screen touch sensing. In bringing it up, he wrote a demo in CircuitPython with the Adafruit_FocalTouch library - he says it just worked! The device includes [STEMMA](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-stemma/blob/master/README.md) ports, GPIO and I2C. 

He also posts:

> So I’m realizing: I need to redesign as a Feather board. Either SAMD51J or ESP32-S2. Imagine using this with a LoRa wing for radio stuff, or controlling a power relay. So many options! And if I can keep it simple, maybe this is a gadget that I could look into having manufactured.

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep checking back for updated download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This pass week has been busy with development, primarily on the BNO080 but also a new project! The work on the BNO080 has been attempting to get the SPI mode working correctly and reliably. The I2C mode has been working excellently and without issue, however it seems that the sensor is less willing to work without issue when the user/developer hasn’t quite gotten everything correct with SPI. My testing leads me to believe that the issue is due to responding to packets being received correctly, however I can’t confirm it.

Taking a break from the SPI support, I was able to do some refactoring and cleanup the code, which allowed me to relatively easily add support for new sensor report types. In BNO080/Hillcrest Labs speak, a sensor report is a packet of information that represents a measurement from a sensor or sensor fusion algorithm. I’ve added the gyro, magnetometer, and linear acceleration (acceleration with the gravity offset removed), in addition to the rotation vector quaternion. There are still a few remaining report types to include in addition to a multitude of configuration options, so it’s not quite done yet but it is progressing well.

To take a break from the BNO which had been monopolizing my time, I switched gears to getting the latest revision of the CAN FeatherWing up and running. After a bit of wrangling, I was able to get a Feather M4 Express, Feather Sense, and a Edge Badge all talking to each other on a shared bus. For now they’re only sending simple messages to each other, however it should be enough to allow me to start working on CircuitPython support for the MCP2515 CAN controller that it uses. I also spent some time working with Jepler on brainstorming about CAN APIs so that we can ensure a common interface for native and SPI CAN controllers.

I finished debugging HCI \_bleio and submitted a [PR](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/3310). I had to use a Saleae (see above), and add code to output extra data on a spare pin to see what was going on internally. Scott has reviewed the PR, and I'm now making a few fixes. The PR should be merged within a few days.

The next CircuitPython 6.0.0 alpha release, 6.0.0-alpha.3, is nearly ready, and by the time you read this, it should be out. The release after that we hope will include both HCI \_bleio and also Scott's [Wifi support for the ESP32-S2](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/3326), so watch for that soon.

I've been trying to automate or at least facilitate the data-gathering we do to prepare the release notes for each CircuitPython release. Right now it's pretty much done by hand. To this end, I've been [trying out the GraphQL interface to GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/), which facilitates some but not all of the queries I want to do.

New project time, which means a new rat's nest of wires on my desk.

We're starting on CAN bus support in CircuitPython.  The first hardware we'll add it to is the SAM E54 Xplained board, because the E54 microcontroller has a built in CAN peripheral.  However, my testing network here consists of two STM32F405 Feathers running MicroPython, which has its own implementation of CAN.

CAN is interesting because it is used inside of automobiles but can also be used as a small network between microcontrollers.  If you have any use cases for CAN bus let us know on Discord #circuitpython so we can keep them in mind as we create this API.

I finally finished the fritzing object for the BrainCraft HAT. That one was a beast, including a fix to the board file, updating some of the sub-components, and bringing in parts from other objects. But it's done! Looks great.

I finished the library pull request sweep, and have been following up with replies to my comments and messages. It was good to go through everything and make sure we hadn't missed anything.

I did a bunch of misc that had been assigned to me over time. I tested a PR to Adafruit CircuitPython Motor. I updated the MotorKit guide to show how to use multiple I2C devices. Followed up on GitHub assignments. I update the RGB Matrix FeatherWing guide with the new nRF FeatherWing. Reviewed various PRs.

Spent some time updating the LIS3DH guide to include the new STEMMA QT version, so whether you have the original or have gotten your hands on one of the new versions, you'll know how to wire it up and get it going.

Next up is updating some motor driver guides to include CircuitPython usage.

This week I've been working on fixing a variety of bugs across multiple ports. I started out with a bug that was crashing the Meowbit at startup, which turned out to be multiple issues related to low power, displayio changes, and pulseio pointer problems. I also revisited some older issues on the STM32 which were simply out of date, having been fixed a long time ago by wider-scale improvements to the port. After that, I've been spending time on a variety of problems on the ESP32-S2 and STM32, including fixing the TRNG module across both ports, debugging a crash related to DisplayIO on the ESP32, dealing with problems related to Makefile comment style, and logging some potential issues with the filesystem. It's somewhat scattered work, but it's good to make sure that major bugs don't linger in the issues list for too long, and I've often found that investigating an issue in one port turns up undocumented problems in others.

In my off time, this past week I finished a breakout Featherwing for the Dynamixel AX-12 servo motor to go with my [library](https://github.com/hierophect/Circuitpython_Dynamixel). I've been meaning to get back into making my own hardware, and it seems like the assembly options for PCBs have gotten a lot cheaper recently, which really lowers the barrier to entry for my projects. I'm excited to see how these ones turned out when they arrive this week.

This past week I took a little time off, so I only ended up working a couple of days. I was doing a bit of catching up, so I had a mix of small projects. I wrote a basic weather demo that uses the MatrixPortal library. I also wrote another quick demo to display some information about the phase of the moon. I  updated some GitHub issues and tested out some code. Finally, I started creating a library to contain some shell scripting functions to make it easier to convert some of our Raspberry Pi Installation scripts over to Python.

**Scott**

I've finally gotten a pull request (PR) out for [native wifi support on the ESP32-S2](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/3326)! I also sent out a [PR for PSRAM support](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/3315) as well. So, things are picking up. We're going to be finding and fixing bugs as folks test all of this new stuff.

This coming week I'll be refining the open PRs to get them merged and also working to get PRs out for my improvements to the Requests library. The improvements tweak the API to work with the native wifi support and reduce the memory overhead of loading JSON.
