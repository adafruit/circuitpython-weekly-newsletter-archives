## Adafruit Update

[![Adafruit Heart New York](../assets/20200428/heart.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/03/22/covid/)

Adafruit Industries continues to run with 100% of employees being paid and continuing to work. Most are working remotely, with some working in the Manhattan, New York factory as an essential service and business under NYC Executive Order 202.6 Capabilities. Adafruit was deemed an essential service to distribute/make some PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) such as face shields, and manufacturer electronics for essential life-saving/preserving equipment and development which is needed in New York and beyond - [Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/03/22/covid/).

Are you looking to buy Adafruit parts during this time?

If you are a general customer, Adafruit suggests checking out [Digi-Key and other Adafruit distributors](https://www.adafruit.com/buyfromdigikey) who may have stock.

Your order may qualifies as essential if you are working on direct efforts to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. This can mean a number of things, as the struggle to contain and fight COVID-19, and treat those effected, are pervasive. Likely this means, your order:

* Contains electronics, tools, or materials that will be used to manufacture PPE, or other medical supplies, for healthcare providers or government agencies working specifically to combat COVID-19
* Is shipping directly to a doctor or medical/healthcare professional
* Is shipping directly to an educator who is working to set up online learning for their classroom due to COVID-19 related school closures
* Contains microelectronics/semi-conductors that will be used in essential manufacturing or research & development (e.g. food, health/ventilator, medical, safety, defense production)

If you are unclear if your order qualifies, email support@adafruit.com before placing an order. Include all pertinent information. - [How to Place an Essential, COVID-19 Related Order at Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-place-an-essential-covid-19-related-order-at-adafruit?view=all).

## Automating Production with Python: CadQuery

[![Programmable USB Hub Panels](../assets/20200428/20200428cadquery.jpg)](https://www.crowdsupply.com/capable-robot-components/programmable-usb-hub/updates/start-of-production)

We've loved the [Programmable USB Hub](https://www.crowdsupply.com/capable-robot-components/programmable-usb-hub) from Capable Robot Components since before its CrowdSupply introduction. It turns out, fabrication of pieces like the panels for the enclosure are done with Python. CadQuery is a Python-based mechanical design framework with an associated library for the creation of assemblies called cqparts.

The designers state that they know other code-based frameworks exist, like OpenSCAD and ImplicitCAD, but they’ve been using CadQuery because:

* It's Python, not a new domain-specific language (DSL) to learn.
* It has a great geometry selection, sort of like CSS, called CadQuery String Selectors.
* It is built on top of OpenCascade, a powerful solid modeling kernel.
* cqparts has powerful mating and constraint features, including mates which modify the geometry of the underlying part.

Their blog post has additional details - [CrowdSupply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/capable-robot-components/programmable-usb-hub/updates/start-of-production).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This week I continued working to migrate it repositories to GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Things are moving along smoothly and I've got a nice workflow developed that makes it fairly straightforward to move a repo over.

I'm also working on migrating the Arduino libraries that are not already using it to use [our Adafruit_BusIO library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BusIO) to handle communicating with chips over SPI and I2C. I'm particularly fond of the [Adafruit_BusIO_RegisterBIts](https://adafruit.github.io/Adafruit_BusIO/html/class_adafruit___bus_i_o___register_bits.html) class to handle all the bit masking and manipulation necessary for toggling groups of bits within a register without stepping on the other bits. Doing this type of manipulation by hand is a great way to create a bug that's tricky to find, so using a library such as ours that gets a lot of testing through use is a good way to reduce the chances of such a mistake biting you.

Most of you will have heard about the passing of [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway), who is most famously known as the creator of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a classic example of how a simple set of rules can create and amazing variety of behaviors. Programming a version of Conway's Game of Life is a right of passage for programmers around the world, myself included. If you know how to program and you haven't given it a try, give it a whirl!

**Dan**

I'm still working on implementing the Adafruit BLE services needed to talk to the [Bluefruit Playground app](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-playground-app). It is mostly done, but there were some changes needed to CircuitPython. After that's done I will look at using bleak on a host computer to implement \_bleio under Blinka.

I'm also going to look at BLE-capable bathroom scales and blood pressure monitors, so we can talk to them too.

**Jeff**

I released CircuitPython 5.3.0-rc.0 this week.  If you encounter any problems with it, please let us know on Discord, the forums, or on github.  Thank you to all who contributed to this new version, it is a community effort.

The RGB Matrix code (formerly known as Protomatter) I've been working on for several weeks is in the new release, and the related guide has been [published](https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-matrices-matrix-panels-with-circuitpython).

We've got pinouts for 5 different CircuitPython boards and 4 examples ranging from simple scrolling text to an implementation of John Conway's "Game of Life".

John Conway's dedication to "recreational mathematics" was an important element in my own development of love for mathematics and computers.  Conway recently passed away.

**Kattni**

I've been working on going through the GitHub issues across all of our CircuitPython libraries. Our helpful friend Adabot includes generating a list of all the open issues and PRs across all of the libraries, and aggregates them on [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). Many issues and PRs are closed within days or less of opening, but a significant number are long-standing. Some of them are that way for a reason, but there are definitely a few that were simply missed, needed further action, or have been resolved but not closed. The plan here is not to close everything out, but to catch the few and get them taken care of. This week, I found a couple of issues waiting on replies, and a few that had already been resolved and simply needed to be closed. Thanks to Carter for picking up two issues and getting new PRs submitted to address them. As well, I found a long-standing PR that needed a couple of simple changes, and the original author was available to get those submitted - thanks to [@tgs](https://github.com/tgs) for patience and perseverance!

Expect to see activity on some older issues and PRs. If you are the author of any of those, and wish to have someone take another look, feel free to ping me and I'll do what I can. With no action for an extended period of time, some of them may simply be closed out - please don't see it as negative if yours ends up closed. Remember, you can always reopen or resubmit a PR or issue if you find time later to return to it.

We've finished submitting all of the Adafruit hardware to the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://oshwa.org) for certification - and the certifications have been rapidly going through. Adafruit is now the number one open source certified company! Thanks so much to Dylan for all of his hard work getting everything submitted.

This past week I worked mostly on documentation settings and reviews for the STM port. For some time, the ST dev boards for CircuitPython did not list their supported modules correctly in the Support Matrix. This week I revisited the reasons why, and ended up revising a number of flags across the build process, making the process of developing a new port more standard across all of CircuitPython. I also worked on reviewing some submitted bugfix PRs, and the additions of the F746 Discovery and F746 Nucleo boards. This coming week, I'll be diving into the documentation for i.MX boards and doing further structural reviews once Scott's low-power code is merged. 

Outside my port work, I've been working with a friend on developing a new minimal STM32 dev board for CircuitPython that we're hoping to launch in the next few months. Our hope is to make a tiny, castellated module that can be easily inserted into a prototype design, and then copied as an eagle design bloc when the design is ready for assembly. We'll hopefully have some pictures to show in the coming weeks.

This past week I focused on moving several repositories over from using Travis CI to GitHub Actions. One of the things involved in doing that was going through and making sure the code was formatted properly and documented. The hardest library to move over was Blinka because it involved addressing over 800 items that PyLint found. Most of these were making sure all of the files, classes, and public functions were properly documented, but it had code improvement suggestions as well. However, it was completely worth it because now when new code is submitted, it will be checked that it is properly formatted prior to being merged in.

I also finished up adding support for the Onion Omega2+ in Blinka and merged it in and tested it. I had to adjust the SPI module that I wrote for the Adafruit PureIO library to work with the MIPS chip and it works just as well as the built-in SpiDev module. I also tested I2C and UART and so far it seems to be working great. You can get more information about it at https://circuitpython.org/blinka/onion_omega2plus/.

At the end of last week I finished the RGBMatrix and STM32 F7/H7 reviews. Then, I continued work on the ESP32-S2 port. I streamed my work at 2pm Pacific on Friday and plan to this week as well. Here is last week's: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjC53UXKN7k

This week I circled back to my never-ending low power PR. I merged in the STM32 changes, tested and fixed it. So, fingers crossed, it should be close to being merged. Timing should be good because more folks have been asking for it. Expect to see it in 5.4.0.

The rest of this week and next will hopefully be ESP32-S2 focused. I'm looking forwards to jumping back in.
