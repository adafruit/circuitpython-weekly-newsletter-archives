## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

As expected this past week has seen me working on libraries for the ICM20948 9-DoF IMU from InvenSense. The sensor is close enough to the ICM20649 that I was able to refactor those libraries to add support for the accelerometer and gyro, however the magnetometer is another story.

[![Bryan](../assets/03172020/03172020bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

As mentioned last week, the ICM20948 takes an interesting approach to adding a 3-axis magnetometer to the common pairing of an accelerometer and gyro. Like some other 6-DoF accel+gyro combos it has support for gathering data from other sensors on its own external I2C bus. In the case of the ICM20948 however has its magnetometer in the same package but separate from the accel+gryo sitting on the external I2C bus.

The setup of the magnetometer has been assisted by the aforementioned SparkFun library, however its still fairly complex and has been less than straightforward to finish implementing. I hope to wrap it up today and then move on to more new sensors next week.

**Dan**

Last week's CircuitPython 5.0.0 release went smoothly. I removed old 5.0.0 alpha and beta release artifacts from the GitHub releases since they are available on Amazon S3; this speeds up loading the GitHub release pages substantially.

This week, I've been spending a lot of time trying to debug spurious writes to the SAMD51 internal flash. There isn't an obvious cause. I have a user's program that, when power cycled, causes the issue, and have been trimming it down to find the minimum example. This has been difficult: removing seemingly innocuous things causes the problem to go away.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/03172020/03172020jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

My first guide has been published! [ulab: Crunch Numbers fast in CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/ulab-crunch-numbers-fast-with-circuitpython/overview).  It has four examples including a way to use light sensor together with a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter to measure your pulse on an [Adafruit CLUE](https://www.adafruit.com/clue).

ulab (pronounced "micro lab") lets you perform number crunching tasks in CircuitPython more quickly, often around 10x as fast. This can be very handy when dealing with sensor data, as we'll see below.

Right now, you need to get the "absolute newest" version of CircuitPython to have ulab enabled.  It'll be in the stable version no sooner than when 5.1.0 is released.

**Kattni**

This week I've been working on the [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Sense guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-sense/) for the [Feather Sense](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4516). This latest edition to the Feather family is a Feather nRF52840 packed with a bunch of sensors. The guide has everything you need to know about the Feather Sense including an overview, detailed pinouts, and info on using it with both Arduino and CircuitPython, and resources for more details on the board and each of the sensors. I also included a CircuitPython example that prints data from all the sensors to get you started with your CircuitPython Feather Sense project. Check it out!

We've also been working to update [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) and implement using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) on all of our libraries. The updates are moving quickly and smoothly. Thanks to Dylan for all his hard work on this project. We'll be releasing the updates for each library as we go. This will not cause any changes to how you use the code, and it will bring all of the code up to current standards and make it more readable.

**Lucian**

This past week I worked on PulseIn, completing the PulseIO trio (PWMOut, PulseOut, and PulseIn). It turned out to be a straightforward implementation given how simple the EXTI system is on STM32, and matches the existing implementations on the SAMD51 and NRF52 closely in terms of performance. However, I'll need to refactor out some of the external interrupt system for use by modules like RotaryIO and the upcoming power improvements which rely on it to wake from sleep. 

Coming up next I'm working on implementing the STM32H743. There's some structural changes that need to be implemented for the F7 and H7 lines - even the port directory is `stm32f4` - so I'm working on mapping out everything that might end up breaking so I can be proactive about addressing it. I'm hoping to have some early builds in the works for the Nucleo F743 this coming week. 

**Melissa**

This past week, I started working on implementing Web Bluetooth using advertisements, but things didn't go as expected. I wrote a very basic sniffer to see the It seems the implementation for the advertisements portion of Web Bluetooth is not quite as complete as the connection-based portion and it was inconsistent between platforms. We are going to wait for further development to be completed before resuming that.

Since I wasn't able to work on the advertisements, I switched over to working on GitHub issues and Pull Requests. I was able to merge in several PRs that had been waiting on me. I spent a little time focusing on some issues that were still affecting the Raspberry Pi since Buster had been released and busted things that had not been resolved. A user had posted a possible solution to get the TFT rotation on capacitive touch displays working and I was able to take it further and fixed that portion of it at least.

The next project I'll be working on is writing up a guide for adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect so that users can more easily add their favorite boards themselves.

**Scott**

I've spent the last week switching CircuitPython's time keeping to the real time counter (RTC) within the nRF and just begun SAMD work. Previously we used the Systick timer that runs when the CPU does. When we sleep, we turn the CPU off to save power. So, by moving to the RTC we can still keep time while asleep.

This work has been a bit tricky because some of our native C modules use the internal clock as a reference and the RTC has less precision than SysTick. The main example of this is PulseIn which uses the internal time to know when a pulse edge arrives. Other native modules, such as AudioOut, do processing in the background in order to keep data flowing and we need to make sure and wake up every so often if we need to do that.

As I work on this I've been testing lifetime of a 105mAh battery powered CircuitPlayground Bluefruit. It broadcasts its internal temperature and battery voltage every 60 seconds. In the chart above you can see the log of battery voltage over time. The left section is with stock 5.0.0 and the right is with the latest version of [my lower_power branch](https://github.com/tannewt/circuitpython/tree/lower_power). It is still going so stay tuned to see how long it ends up running.

Overall, the work is promising. It'll lay a foundation for further low power optimization in CircuitPython and make it better for battery powered sensors and conference badges.

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/03172020/31720helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4 and later versions is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
