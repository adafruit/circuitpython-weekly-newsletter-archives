## Python events happening this coming week

### EuroPython Conference July 23 - 26

[![EuroPython 2020](../assets/20200721/europython2020.jpg)](https://ep2020.europython.eu/)

EuroPython 2020 this year will be an online conference from July 23-26. The schedule is now available - [Website](https://ep2020.europython.eu/schedule/).

Attending the conference days will require a ticket, participating in the sprint days will be free - [EuroPython](https://blog.europython.eu/post/614102095419850752/europython-2020-online-conference-from-july-23-26).

### PyOhio 2020 July 25-26

[![PyOhio 2020](../assets/20200721/20200721pyohio.jpg)](https://www.pyohio.org/2020/)

The 13th annual PyOhio will be July 25-26, 2020. The online event will consist of 5 and 10-minute talks, sprints, and discussion - [Events Overview](https://www.pyohio.org/2020/events/overview/) and [Registration](https://www.pyohio.org/2020/attend/register/).

[![PyOhio 2020 T-Shirts Fundraiser](../assets/20200721/20200721pyohioshirts.jpg)](https://www.pyohio.org/2020/attend/register/)

PyOhio typically uses t-shirt sales as their primary fundraiser. Because the costs of running the virtual event this year are low and because they aren't able to host their Young Coders class, they've decided to use their fundraiser to support an organization that aligns with our mission: [Black Girls CODE](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/).

Shipping 2 weeks after the conference, they're available in 3 cuts. Be sure to check the sizing charts for each as they're all different! - [Order your t-shirts here!](https://www.customink.com/fundraising/pyohio-2020)

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep checking back for updated download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

[![Bryan](../assets/20200721/20200721bryan1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Continuing the story from last week, the AS7341 saw a good amount of time on my bench over the past week. As it so happens, I was incorrect when I mentioned "12 readable individual sensors". In addition to being a travesty of a sentence, it was incorrect! After spending time getting close with the sensor and what little example code I was able to find, I found that there are in fact 23 individual sensors that can be connected to any one of the six ADC channels. This by itself gives the sensor a large amount of flexibility; you can choose which color bands you wish to measure at any given time and even potentially change the configuration based on the data coming in.

[![Bryan](../assets/20200721/20200721bryan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Keeping in mind all the possible combinations from being able to select the sensor connected to each ADC, you can imagine my surprise when I found that *you can attach more than one sensor to an ADC channel at a time*. OK. Maybe my nerd is showing but I think that is *pretty dang cool*. This means that you can effectively adjust the sensitivity of the sensor without adjusting gain or integration time by selecting if you are measuring from one or two sensors for the given channel.

[![Bryan](../assets/20200721/20200721bryan3.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The possibility that intrigues me is that of connecting multiple sensors from different wavelength bands to the same ADC. The documentation is a bit sparse and doesn't explicitly state if this is possible or not, so we'll have to see if it works. I'm not entirely sure  how useful it would be, but it feels useful. 

**Dan**

[![Dan](../assets/20200721/20200721dan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_protocols#Host_Controller_Interface_(HCI)) implementation of \_bleio is progressing. I've gotten advertising to work, and next will work on connecting as a peripheral. Unfortunately the ESP32 hardware doesn't support extended advertising, but that's not a serious limitation for most BLE applications.

**Jeff**

My work refining the way background tasks are handled in CircuitPython continues, hopefully concluding soon.  I've tested the code on a wider range of boards (initially I concentrated on SAMD51) and opened it up for review and testing by the community.

On a less technical note, for the first time I moderated the CircuitPython weekly meeting on Discord.  I particularly enjoyed getting to read the community news section, which is based on content from this very newsletter.

**Kattni**

This week I updated the BMP280 guide with the new STEMMA QT version of the breakout, including updated pinouts, downloads and wiring diagrams. I created all the wiring diagrams for the PCF8591 guide that Bryan completed. Melissa implemented PWMOut in Adafruit Blinka, our CircuitPython compatibility layer for Raspberry Pi and other single board computers, which means it's now super simple to pulse an LED or control a servo with your Raspberry Pi. To that end, I updated the CircuitPython on Linux and Raspberry Pi guide to include a PWM Outputs & Servos page with wiring diagrams and example code. 

Last week I started the PMSA300I air quality sensor guide. This week, I received the sensor, so I can continue with the code sections of the guide. It uses I2C and comes with STEMMA QT connectors, so it's super simple to get it wired up. It works with the Adafruit CircuitPython PM25 library, so it's easy to read air quality data using CircuitPython with this sensor. This guide will include an overview, pinouts, Arduino and CircuitPython usage, and resource downloads. Along with this, the PM2.5 air quality sensor guide will be updated to use the new PM25 library - it currently reads the data directly and is not as simple or intuitive as the library will make it. If you're looking to get started with your PMSA300I air quality sensor or looking for a simpler way to use your PM2.5 sensor, keep an eye out for these guides. 

**Lucian**

This week I set up the toolchains and control test setup for my ESP32-S2, and read up on the timer docs for when I start working on PulseIO. I also worked on some changes to the Protomatter RGBMatrix library so that it cooperates properly with my new timer allocator system, and investigated an issue with PulseIn that's related to IRQ management. 

I've also been chatting with some international folks about a possible implementation of the F1 family for STM32, which has some very cheap boards, especially when purchased direct from China. The F1 is on the low performance side for Circuitpython, but the upper end of the family is comparable to the SAMD 21 and 51 chips, and the prices are rock bottom for many packages. It'll be interesting to see how the project develops.

This week I finished up 2 guides around using an eInk display to to display some useful information. The first one I did was a weather station, which is based on the Weather Station available for PyPortal, but with some changes so that it works nicely on eInk displays such as less frequent updates. You can [check out that guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-e-ink-weather-station-using-python).

The second guide I wrote is an event calendar that was inspired by a project called Up Next, except this one is written in Python. This project goes out and connects with Google Calendar and retrieves the events from all of your calendars so that you can see what events are coming up soon. [That guide is also on the Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-e-ink-desk-calendar-using-python/).

This week I've continued work on improving our ESP32SPI and Requests libraries. I've been specifically trying to reduce the number and size of allocations when processing a request so that larger files can be loaded.

Last Friday on my stream I also optimized CircuitPython's json module so that we don't need to give it a stream of data instead of a full string of json. That should greatly reduce the largest single allocation. See the full stream on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfRjlu3oCDA). 

I've gotten requests working with HTTP and decided to compare against the existing implementation. To do so, I needed a way to measure memory allocation counts. So, I'm adding a memorymonitor module that will help make it easier to understand the memory use of a section of CircuitPython code. Once I added that, I discovered I was allocating *more* smaller objects with the new code and want to reduce that. So, I'm also adding an AllocationAlarm class to memorymonitor that will simply throw an exception when an allocation occurs over a minimum block size. It should be helpful to know certain chunks of code are allocation free.

Check out my latest stream, Fridays at 2pm Pacific on youtube.com/adafruit for the latest.
