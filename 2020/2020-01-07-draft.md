## Initial CircuitPython MIMXRT10XX port implementation

[![NXP](../assets/01072020/1720nxp.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/2456)

[![NXP](../assets/01072020/1720nxp2.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/2456)

It begins! The commit adds the NXP i.MX RT10XX series port, so far supporting the RT1011 and RT1062 chips but the whole family is very similar so it's easy to expand. CircuitPython snakes its way to the powerful NXP i.MX RT family of MCUs, 500+ MHz and up to 1 MB RAM. [Arturo](https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1199841134253682690) is working on 2 Feathers: RT1011 + ESP32, and RT1062 with more GPIOs broken out (including the LCD interface) and a SD card - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/2456).

>_"an Adafruit FT232H Breakout, $15, which Limor Fried, founder of Adafruit, called the ["modern parallel port"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=965&v=CYBi0CEoR1A). It’s a USB bridge that you can use to speak useful, well-known protocols like SPI and I2C, or — in our case — less-useful, dance protocols via general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins. This thing is super cool: extremely approachable, easy to use, no IDE. It’s a great starting point for anyone who wants to write software that can control simple electronics."_

[![Feather Bluefruit Sense](../assets/01072020/1720bsense.jpg)](https://youtu.be/BbNj23MP_C8)

Since we've experimented with adding all sorts of sensors to our new CLUE board (see previous newsletters for more info about CLUE) - we thought we'd try adding the same bevy of sensor goodness to a Feather nRF52840. We removed the SWD connector and also the optional 32 Khz crystal. In their place we added a PDM mic, LSM6DS33 accel/gyro + LIS3MDL magnetometer, SHT3x humidity sensor, BMP280 or DPS310 barometric pressure sensor, and APDS-9960 color/light/proximity/gesture sensor. Should a fun little feather board, will pair very nicely with a ADALOGGER featherwing for RTC+SD card datalogging  - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/BbNj23MP_C8).

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/01072020/1720blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed.

## What's the team up to?

What is the team doing? Let's find out!

**Bryan**  

This week I did a bunch of  PR reviews and debugging to continue the CircuitPython libraries' migration to GitHub Actions. The end is in sight! I've also started workin on migrating the Arduino libraries that I've worked on to Actions as well. I also did some editing to the MCP4728 guide to clarify some sections and add additional examples to my explanation of how Vref works.

**Dan**  

[![Dan](../assets/01072020/1720dan.png)](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/issues/21#issuecomment-571007629)

I've finished coding BLE bonding and am now testing. There is a sort of [mini version of numpy for MicroPython](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab) called `ulab` . @GathererA on GitHub is porting it to CircuitPython; I got him past a few [mysterious bugs over the weekend](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/issues/21#issuecomment-571007629).

**Kattni**  

[![Kattni](../assets/01072020/1720kattni.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-made-easy-on-circuit-playground-express)

I had a lovely holiday and I hope everyone else did as well. I'm picking up this week where I left off, updating the [CircuitPython Made Easy on Circuit Playground Express and Bluefruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-made-easy-on-circuit-playground-express) guide to support both Express and Bluefruit using the latest updates to the Circuit Playground library. The guide update is still in progress as of Friday, but is nearly complete. The final thing to add is a page for the new sound features available for Circuit Playground Bluefruit. It should be ready to go very soon. The guide is already live, so you can check it out now. After that, I'll be starting a new project involving motors and CircuitPython. We have a lot of motor support, but not nearly enough examples, so we're going to take care of that with an upcoming motor party. Keep an eye out for that!

...back to work polishing some pull requests related to JEplayer and getting back to feature work there if nothing else grabs my attention. In the realm of personal projects, I'm creating a hand-wired keyboard with a 3D printed enclosure.  So I am excited to learn about [KMK: Clackety Keyboards Powered by Python](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware) and plan to put it to use soon.

**Melissa** 

[![Melissa](../assets/01072020/1720melissa.png)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week I caught up with all of my messages and since I didn't have my hardware with me on Monday, I focused on updating the circuitpython.org website and added a counter to display the number of boards that support CircuitPython as well as the Blinka boards. I finished up working on the Animated Gif Player and refactored it into a class. I am currently working on writing up a guide for this. There is still lots of room for improvement and I plan on improving it over time, but feel it's in a great place to be able to implement any improvements. I started working on HT16K33 updates and implemented a function from a previous library called set_digit_raw() and have added that to the library. I also spent some time working on getting the Onion Omega2 up and running to test a Pull Request and am in a good position to help with any remaining Blinka development.

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/01072020/1720helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
