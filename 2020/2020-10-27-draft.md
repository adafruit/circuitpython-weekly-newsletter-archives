## A VSCode plugin for CircuitPython workflow

[![VSCode plugin for CircuitPython](../assets/20201027/20201027vsc.jpg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joedevivo.vscode-circuitpython&ssr=false)

[Joe DeVivo](https://www.joedevivo.com/) has released a free plug-in for the Microsoft VSCode editor (also free) to bring the entire CircuitPython workflow into a single place within the editor: vscode-circuitpython. It includes:

- A library manager
- Serial console
- Autocomplete

More - [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joedevivo.vscode-circuitpython&ssr=false) and [GitHub](https://github.com/joedevivo/vscode-circuitpython).

## M.2 form factor boards go mainstream in the Maker space

[![MicroMod from SparkFun](../assets/20201027/20201027mm.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/3421)

SparkFun has come out with a line of processors on a card called MicroMod, the idea being a different processor may be swapped into a design with few if any code changes.  SparkFun has open-sourced the pinout - that step makes it easy to use the pre-made modules or to design your own board or carrier module - [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/3421).

[![M.2 board pinouts reference](../assets/20201027/20201027feather2.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/M.2)

Other manufacturers have released boards prior to SparkFun in the M.2 form factor. Adafruit has developed a GitHub repo of information on various M.2 board pinouts - a very handy reference - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/M.2).

[![Snapzz to Feather Adapter](../assets/20201027/20201027feather1.jpg)](https://twitter.com/thorstenjaeger/status/1319747219310903296)

[![MicroMod to Feather Adapter](../assets/20201027/20201027feather3.jpg)](https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1319764336689238019)

Makers are looking at MicroMod processors and adapting the form factor to other form factors, like the Feather pinout, on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/miami6/status/1320259512234889216), [here](https://twitter.com/thorstenjaeger/status/1319747219310903296), and [here](https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1319764336689238019). Nice work! Maybe a Metro form factor?

This may be great for CircuitPython and MicroPython in addition to Arduino in that the Python languages abstract out many of the hardware differences. Hopefully the community will look to do that.

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep checking back for updated download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This past week I completed the EMC2101 fan controller libraries for CircuitPython and Arduino, which means I will shortly start working on the guide.I continue to be impressed with this and other similar small, focused chips that do one or two related things and nothing else. While some may see such a chip and compare it unfavorably to another that has more bells and whistles, there is value in the flexibility that comes from having a discrete bit of functionality in its own modular piece. Sometimes you do want the flexibility of a Swiss Army Knife that can do many things, however many other times you just need a knife to cut something.

Earlier in the week I was able to assemble the latest version of the CAN Feather Wing and verify that the changes worked as expected. With any luck, this means that we should see one showing up in the store before too long. One interesting side effect to working on this project is that I’ve started noticing CAN bus showing up in more and more places. At this point I’m fairly sure that I’m late to the party and CAN bus has been popular for a while, however I also get the feeling that it’s seeing more and more use. I’m fairly certain that it will become even more widely known and used as more people  become familiar with its benefits. As ladyada is fond of saying, people need to use more wires. Wireless is great and all, but just like planes can be more fussy than good ‘ole trains, wires will get your bits where they need to go, even if they lack the glamour of yer Narrow Band IOT or Z-Wave.

**Dan**

I am finishing up a Learn Guide for the  Blinka \_bleio library. While working on the examples I found a regression in the bleak library, which I reported and is now fixed. I have a few more examples to write and then I'll be all done.

**Jeff**

I've been learning the ropes of ESP32-S2 development and started implementing canio. I ran into some problems that may be in the esp-idf but created a workaround. The CAN hardware in the ESP32-S2 is also more limited when it comes to reception filters. In any case, the pull request is waiting for review. It will be 6.1.0 or later before it is incorporated in a stable release of CircuitPython.

**Kattni**

I've been working on a guide for a QT Py project involving NeoPixels and an LIS3DH accelerometer. It's an activity timer that doubles as a hydration reminder. The activity timer designed to be a simple reminder to take a break every so often or eat lunch, and then get back to work. The hydration reminder counts down an interval to remind you to regularly drink water. The guide walks you through the build, and covers all the customisations available in the code. You can easily change the colors and times to fit your aesthetics and schedule. Keep an eye out for the guide soon!

**Melissa**

This past week, I worked on a guide for running [Google Assistant on the BrainCraft HAT](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-google-assistant-on-the-braincraft-hat). Running the software on the Raspberry Pi was the easy part. The difficult part was getting all of the different Google interfaces configured correctly because halfway through, the wrong project is selected. I'm glad that I was able to work through this and document it in the guide because I think it would have been very frustrating for a user to have run into this. Voice Bonnet support will be added soon.

I also worked on another guide for [creating projects using the MatrixPortal library](https://learn.adafruit.com/creating-projects-with-the-circuitpython-matrixportal-library). This goes through some of the capabilities of the library and choosing the different layers that you want to use in your project including some of the tradeoffs for choosing one method over the other. It also goes into a fairly detailed code analysis of one of the example projects that uses quite a few of the features of the library.

**Scott**

Last week I released 6.0.0 Release Candidate 0. I've done a few minor fixes after it that will lead to a second release candidate.

Most of my week has been working on adding grayscale e-paper display support to CircuitPython for the newest [e-paper display FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4777).  It's a neat display!

I've got more work to do on the [e-paper display](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDWn37FbtGM) because there are a few outstanding bugs. The current bug I'm looking at is that the display only refreshes once and then fails going forwards.

My goal was to work on the deep sleep API but I've gotten sidetracked by the new e-paper display. Both things will be done eventually though because of this top secret product :-)

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/20201027/codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
