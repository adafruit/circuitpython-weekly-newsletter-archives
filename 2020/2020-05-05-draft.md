## ESP32-S2 Hack Chat with Adafruit

[![ESP32-S2 Hack Chat with Adafruit](../assets/20200505/20200505espchat.jpg)](https://hackaday.io/event/170992-esp32-s2-hack-chat-with-adafruit)

Announced in September 2019, the ESP32-S2 is finally making it into hobbyist's hands. With WiFi, a much faster CPU, scads of GPIO, ADCs, a RISC-V co-processor, native USB, and the promise of very low current draw, the ESP32-S2 may prove to be popular with hobbyists as it becomes established.

To talk through the new chip's potential, Limor "Ladyada" Fried and Scott Shawcroft, both of Adafruit Industries, will join Hackaday.io on the Hack Chat. Learn everything you need to know about the ESP32-S2, and how to put it to work for you.

Tune in on Wednesday, May 6, 2020 at noon US Pacific Time - [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/event/170992-esp32-s2-hack-chat-with-adafruit).

## An MQTT-based CircuitPython Library for Azure IoT

[![Use CircuitPython with IoT Central!](../assets/20200505/20200505azure.gif)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things/use-circuitpython-with-iot-central/ba-p/1276986)

As a Hackathon exploration, Microsoft adapted an IoT Central Python library to create an MQTT-based CircuitPython library for Azure IoT. CircuitPython, Adafruit’s version of Python for embedded development, is easy to use and significantly lowers the barrier of entry for building cool IoT solutions. This library has been tested with the PyPortal device (which has a broad set of capabilities, including a TFT touchscreen display) and a PyBadge. Both of these devices are able to connect via an ESP32 serving as a wi-fi coprocessor - [Microsoft Tech Community Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things/use-circuitpython-with-iot-central/ba-p/1276986#).

Microsoft asks interested parties to check it out and provide feedback - [GitHub](https://github.com/elhorton/Circuitpython-AzureIoT).

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep an eye out here for more download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

The highlight of this week has been working on a project to add the joy of clacky keyboards to the Trellis family! I'm working on a board that has the same 60x60mm dimensions and tessellated I2C pads as the Trellis, NeoTrellis and NeoTrellis M4. This one will be different from the other members of the Trellis because I've replaced the elastomer buttons with mechanical keyboard switches!

Instead of the 4x4 grid of squishy elastomer buttons you'll get a 3x3 array of sockets that fit standard Cherry MX switches. There is a huge range of different switches available from "Bryan, mute your mic" levels of clickyness to buttery soft, silent as a ninja "linear" switches. And since the switches are mounted in sockets instead of soldered in, you can change them out at your whim.

[![Bryan](../assets/20200505/20200505bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

There are still a few things to figure out about the design but I'm hopeful this will pan out and perhaps be just the start ;)

**Dan**

I released the BLE pulse oximeter library, now that the Learn Guide for that project is published.

I've been going in circles a bit on some core changes for BLE PacketBuffer, to make sure it works with the new Adafruit services. I should be done with that soon.

I've tried a BLE-capable body-weight scale and a blood pressure monitor. Unfortunately neither use the standard services defined by the Bluetooth organization, so there will be some reverse engineering.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20200505/20200505jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

For the past week, I've been working on adding RGBMatrix support to the Feather STM32F407.  This is the first time the initial work of porting to a new microcontroller has fallen to me instead of Phil B., and the first real work I've done on an STM microcontroller, so it has been a learning experience.

For fun, I eagerly printed the new [slim enclosure for Adafruit CLUE](https://learn.adafruit.com/clue-slim-case) and used it for a little project with displayio:  A die roller for the FATE role playing system.  In FATE, you use 4 special dice (labeled +, - and blank) together with your character's inherent skill to determine an outcome.  It was a fun chance to learn a little more about how the accelerometer and proximity sensor work, because you can either shake the CLUE or touch the sensor above the screen to roll the dice.

**Kattni**

This week, I've been going through all the open GitHub issues across all of the CircuitPython libraries. While there are many longstanding issues that need to remain open, there are many that can be addressed in some way. I've been pinging original authors to get status updates, closing completed issues, and putting in PRs to resolve some of the quick ones. Expect to see activity across many of the libraries over the next couple of weeks.

As well, I added a new capability to the Circuit Playground library. You can now check which board you have connected, Express or Bluefruit. There are two options. First is the option to check which board is connected and return that piece of information. Second is the option to specify which board to look for and use that to execute code based on which board is connected, e.g. if a Circuit Playground Bluefruit is connected, run the following code. This came out of the sound meter example failing to work on Circuit Playground Bluefruit. There are some features that are not supported by Circuit Playground Express, so it allows for writing sound related code that works on both Express and Bluefruit.

**Lucian**

This past week has mostly been carryover from the previous week, with new bugfixes and documentation changes. I've written a new ReadMe for the STM32 port, which should make it easier for newcomers to understand the port's structure and start getting builds loaded with the new `make flash` command. I've also been doing miscellaneous work on bugfixes, reviews, and a lot of reading about the i.MX RT. 

In my personal time, I risked a drive into the plague-zones (Boston) to retrieve some gear for board testing and a new circuitpython project. While I was there I got to see the PPE manufacturing setup running at the Makerspace where I normally work full time, Artisan's Asylum. They're taking safety very seriously and still churning out seriously impressive quantities of equipment. It was great to see that everyone is safe and to hear updates from them - from an approved distance of 6ft, of course. 

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on adding the Rock Pi S to Blinka. This included adding some more tools such as a SysFS Pin wrapper so that there are more options to add new boards to Blinka. Additionally, I added Pulse Width Modulation support and Analog Input support to the Rock Pi S, which is the first time I had added those features.

Next up, I will be focusing on improving I2C support of the Raspberry Pi including adding support for unusual configurations as well as working on adding I2C to the external bitbangio CircuitPython library.

At the end of last week I worked more on the ESP32-S2 port. I got CircuitPython to the point of linking the files together and, with the help of folks from my stream, generating lots of linking errors (Previously we had many compiler errors). The end of this week, I'll continue working on the port by fixing the linker issues.

The start of this week was spent on the lower_power PR. There was a weird USB issue on SAMD21 that only came up with certain USB host computers. I got it reproduced here and then Thach also reproduced it and then fixed it. So, it should be ready to merge. :fingers_crossed:

I've also been helping Dylan convert the inline native module docs from RST to Python stubs. That way we'll be able to provide stubs to editors like VS Code that can use it to help with completions.

dunkmann00 has also been working to get PixelBuf launched so that folks have faster NeoPixels. There are a few administrative things to do like releasing the libraries and then updating the frozen version but that shouldn't be too hard.

Lastly, I chatted yesterday with Helen Leigh about CircuitPython for her upcoming Make magazine article. I look forward to reading it.

Thanks to everyone who has helped me this week!
