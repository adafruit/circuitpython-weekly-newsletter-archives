We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## "The awesome power of CircuitPython" Empowering makers to make businesses

[![CircuitBiz](../assets/03102020/31020tindie.jpg)](https://www.tindie.com/products/arturo182/serpente-a-tiny-circuitpython-prototyping-board/?pt=ac_prod_search)

CircuitPython is empowering makers to make businesses. [Arturo](https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1236020534795808768) has [a successful Tindie store](https://www.tindie.com/products/arturo182/serpente-a-tiny-circuitpython-prototyping-board/?pt=ac_prod_search), selling over 400+ CircuitPython powered Serpentes. 

[![CircuitBiz](../assets/03102020/31020arturo.jpg)](https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1236020534795808768)

Serpente is a tiny CircuitPython development board, perfect for quick projects and prototyping! It's [open-source hardware (OSHWA UID SE000002)](https://certification.oshwa.org/se000002.html), and open-source software. When there are updates to CircuitPython, all the new features, enhancements, fixes, and more are automatically available for all users ([downloads for the board are on circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/board/serpente/)). 

[![CircuitBiz](../assets/03102020/31020serpente.jpg)](https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1236020534795808768)

In addition to the boards being available on Tindie, they're also available on [Adafruit.com](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=serpente) now as well. [Arturo](https://twitter.com/arturo182/status/1236020534795808768) writes _"Just sold my 400th Serpente on Tindie - Couldn't have done it without the awesome power of CircuitPython!"_

CircuitPython allows engineers from small businesses to large organizations to participate and thrive in an ecosystem. From the 200+ "batteries included" [libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries), to content marketing, and development resources, CircuitPython is creating businesses and community together. Serpente is a real-time example to watch when open-source software and open-source hardware maximizes its potential. Over half of the 116+ boards on [circuitpython.org/downloads](https://circuitpython.org/downloads) are boards that are not made by Adafruit, it's one of the fastest growing choices for engineers for their hardware.

## CircuitPython for Visual Studio Code

[![VSCode](../assets/03102020/31020vscode.jpg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joedevivo.vscode-circuitpython)

This extension by [Joe DeVivo](https://twitter.com/joedevivo/status/1235001649350856704) aspires to bring the entire CircuitPython workflow into a single place in VSCode. Inspired by [Scott Hanselman's blog post](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/UsingVisualStudioCodeToProgramCircuitPythonWithAnAdaFruitNeoTrellisM4.aspx) and the [VSCode Arduino extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-arduino) - [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joedevivo.vscode-circuitpython).

>_"Circuit Python: Open Serial Console will prompt you for a serial port to connect to, then it will display the serial output form the board attached to that port. The port can be changed by clicking on it's path in the status bar. It will also change your workspace's default board.pyi file for autocomplete to the one that matches the USB Vendor ID & Product ID. If you want to manually choose a different board, a list is availble with the command CircuitPython: Choose CircuitPython Board, and also by clicking on the board name in the status bar.

## Find your way home a CircuitPython GPS Locator - The CLUE finder

[![CLUE Finder](../assets/03102020/31020cluefinder.jpg)](https://back7.co/home/weekend-project-find-your-way-home-with-this-circuit-python-gps-locator)

[Jay](https://twitter.com/back7co/status/1235913549836320768) has a fantastic tutorial on how to make a CircuitPython GPS Locator: The CLUE finder - [back7.co](https://back7.co/home/weekend-project-find-your-way-home-with-this-circuit-python-gps-locator)

>_"When GPS was first released to consumers, it wasn’t even in the hands or understanding of most people.  Early on it was used for pretty unique and esoteric stuff, and in the age before ultra-connected devices that use common smartphone apps, there were GPS receivers.  They pretty much just displayed current coordinates including latitude, longitude, and altitude- not much else.  There’s a great set of old devices over at retro-gps.info.  The old units are big, heavy, slow, and use a ton of power for what they do.  Modern GPS units are light, small, cheap, and use very little power.  I thought it would be cool to revisit the idea. What would a newer one look like, and why not s smartphone?  First, too much reliance is put on a smartphone, and without the need for maps a smartphone is overkill (and a solved problem).  Second, the device I planned to build wouldn’t need internet, and should be as easy to hack/modify as possible.  We don’t need a full fledged OS either- too many moving parts..."_

## ulab: Crunch Numbers fast in CircuitPython

[![ulab](../assets/03102020/31020ulab.gif)](https://learn.adafruit.com/ulab-crunch-numbers-fast-with-circuitpython?view=all)

ulab (pronounced "micro lab") lets you perform number crunching tasks in CircuitPython more quickly, often around 10x as fast. This can be very handy when dealing with sensor data, as we'll see below.

Right now, you need to get the "absolute newest" version of CircuitPython to have ulab enabled.  It'll be in the stable version no sooner than when 5.1.0 is released.

ulab is modeled after numpy, but is not entirely compatible; so after the examples, we'll also provide you with some guidelines to help you move between numpy and ulab.

ulab is not available in Blinka, Adafruit's Single Board Computer layer for CircuitPython - for those boards we recommend using plain numpy since its available! If your code needs to run on both CircuitPython and Blinka, you'll probably either need to use conditional code or forego the use of ulab altogether.

## IoT Design Week with Microchip's "Wizard of Make" Bob Martin and Adafruit

[![IoT Design Week](../assets/03102020/31020iotdesignweek.jpg)](https://youtu.be/fu37Uf-CXNE)

[IoT Design Week with Microchip's "Wizard of Make" Bob Martin and Adafruit](https://events.microchip.com/website/7565/home/). We'll be on 6pm to 7pm ET on Tuesday March 10th, 2020 ([video](https://youtu.be/fu37Uf-CXNE)). Expect to see a lot of CircuitPython!

## EYE on NPI – Espressif ESP32-S2 SoC

[![ESP32S2](../assets/03102020/31020eye_on_npi.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4F25y-P8krM)

We are kicking off a new series “EYE on NPI” with the Espressif ESP32-S2 SoC – purchase them from [Digi-Key Part Number 1965-ESP32-S2CT-ND](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/espressif-systems/ESP32-S2/1965-ESP32-S2CT-ND/11613159) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4F25y-P8krM).

Espressif ESP32-S2 SoC modules and development boards were announced in 2019 and we’re getting closer to having these in hand. Last week Espressif announced the beginning of mass production for the whole series of ESP32-S2 SoCs, modules and development boards, which will make their latest chips readily available to the entire IoT market.

These chips come with a great core, lots of RAM, proven TLS+TCPIP stack, a complete development platform, and lots of code examples. If you’ve used the ESP8266 or ESP32 many elements will be familiar to you! The best new peripheral for this chip is the new USB OTG system. Yes finally native USB comes to ESP!

[![ESP32S2](../assets/03102020/31020eye_on_npi02.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4F25y-P8krM)

You will be able to use our popular TinyUSB free-and-open USB stack with these chips, to unlock USB CDC/HID/MIDI/MSC/and more.

We’re also planning on porting CircuitPython to this chip, it would make for a great set of easy-to-use IoT products. We really think this chip is going to be the ‘winner’ for embedded IoT projects where cost, power and size are most important.

STMicroelectronics ST25DV I2C/NFC EEPROM. Say hello to the ST25DV I2C/NFC EEPROM. We saw a library for the ST25DV was released by STM32duino’s team and took a look at this interesting chip! It has both NFC (Type V) and I2C interfaces, you can write the EEPROM over I2C, then read it from NFC – it even has some fast-message-passing capability that could be used for wireless near-field data transfer. Comes in 4 sizes: ST25DV04K, ST25DV16K, and ST25DV64K.

Nifty stuff! We whipped up a little STEMMA QT compatible breakout to play with this chip. You can also pick up these wireless EEPROMs over at [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/products/en/rf-if-and-rfid/rfid-rf-access-monitoring-ics/880?k=st25dv).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/03102020/31020blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **215**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

This week I've been working on the libraries for the ICM-20948 9-DoF IMU from Invensense. 9-DoFs on one chip is pretty nice, so I'm hard at work getting this chip supported in Arduino and CircuitPython.

One interesting thing about this chip is that the magnetometer is a separate sensor with its own I2C address. It gets more interesting: similar to the LSM6DSOX and ICM330DH, this sensor has an external/master slave bus that it can use to communicate with and get data from other sensors. Normally this would be an interesting but ultimately situational feature, however in the case if the ICM-20948 this magnetometer is _on the external bus_. This means that getting all 9 DoFs requires setting up registers in the ICM20948 to configure the magnetometer and then map its output to another register! It was a bit tricky to figure out but there is a good reference library written by the folks at SparkFun that I was able to use to figure out the S33KR3T C0D3 to get the magnetometer configured properly.

Next up I'll be working on the tester code which will require me to add a few more bells and whistles to the Arduino library to test all the pins without needing to have a convoluted testing setup. Once the hardware is fully verified, I'll move onto the CircuitPython library which should be fairly straightforward now that I've figured things out while writing the Arduino library.

CircuitPython 5.0.0 stable is released! 5.0.0-rc.0 came out a week ago. The build process was failing to upload all the board builds to GitHub reliably; the GitHub release pages are not really designed for the over 1700 release assets we now have per build. For rc.0 I upload the missing builds manually  I then arranged for circuitpython.org to point to our Amazon S3 downloads site, which handles the bulk uploads much more easily . I released 5.0.0-rc.1 over the weekend to test the new downloads, and included a few i.MX fixes as well. The 5.0.0-rc.1 release seemed fine, so I made the 5.0.0 stable release on Monday. This is a huge milestone! Thanks to everyone who has worked on or tested 5.0.0 since we started working on it last July.

This week I'm going to be reverse engineering the radio traffic of a couple of BLE-enabled BBQ thermometers to see if we can figure out how to communicate with them. I also have several issues with the UF2 bootloader to look at and debug.

Subsequent to the 5.0.0 release, the pull request to add ulab to CircuitPython was incorporated.  This paves the way for an upcoming release, probably 5.1.0, to include it for most SAMD51 and nRF52840 based boards that support CircuitPython.  You can get it right now by using the "absolute newest" downloads from CircuitPython.org, and the ulab docs are also live on readthedocs.

This will be a boon for many types of number crunching routines in Python.  For example, converting the "normalized_rms" function from an existing guide took just a few minutes, and performs about 10x faster.  Drop us a note on Discord if you know of a library or guide that could be improved by the use of ulab.

**Kattni**

This week I published a guide for the [CLUE Custom Badge](https://learn.adafruit.com/clue-custom-circuit-python-badge)!

[![Kattni - CLUE Badge](../assets/03102020/03102020kattni.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The new custom badge feature of the Adafruit CircuitPython Pybadger library makes it super simple to display lines of text over a color-block or image background. The guide includes an example of creating a custom badge for CLUE that shows your twitter handle, name, job title, and pronoun. As well, it covers everything you can customise about the badge and how to do it. If you're looking to create a super customisable badge for your next event using your Adafruit CLUE, this guide has you covered!

This project is also part of [PyCon 2020](https://us.pycon.org/2020/) preparation. [Adafruit and Digi-Key are pairing up to sponsor PyCon](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/02/06/get-a-clue-at-pycon-us-from-digi-key-and-adafruit-digikey-adafruit-pycon2020-pycon-circuitpython/) and provide a CLUE to every attendee. Now it will be easy to create a custom badge to show off during the conference on your new CLUE.

This past week I wrapped up my work on PulseOut and my Zephyr learn guide, and moved on to working on PulseIn (the IR pulse detection module for Circuitpython) and researching/preliminary work on the H7 and F7 processors offered by ST. I'm especially excited about these new MCUs given their use on boards like OpenMV - machine vision is something I enjoy tinkering with on my personal projects, and the opportunity to open up Circuitpython to these kinds of modules is very exciting. 

It'll also be fun to see Circuitpython on some of the most powerful chips offered in the Cortex M4/M7 market. I'll be quick to retry all the projects that have been sluggish for me in the past, and see how they perform on a system running at 400MHz!

This past week I finished up the Web Bluetooth dashboard and added a few more services such as being able to change the color of the Neopixels, being able to manipulate a 3D Model on screen and playing a tone from the board. In addition, the Feather Bluefruit Sense came out and it worked great with the dashboard. I also added some more polish to application such as throttling the Frames per Second so it worked smoother.

After finishing that up, I wrote up a guide on using the dashboard. You can check the [guide here](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-connection-based-web-bluetooth-in-chrome). Next I'll be working on a version of the dashboard that works by monitoring BLE advertisements.

**Scott**

I was in Colorado at the end of the week. Thursday I visited SparkFun and met up with Great Scott Gadget folks to chat about CircuitPython. Thanks to everyone for taking the time to chat!

When I got back I had some email catch up to do and then helped a bit with releasing CircuitPython 5.0.0! Please update and let us know how it goes!

I've also been helping with the BroadcastNet demos that JohnPark has been doing.

The rest of this week I'm heads down on optimizing CircuitPython's power consumption so that BroadcastNet sensors and conference badges last longer on their battery charges. The main goal is to make `time.sleep()` actually go into a low power state. I think I can reduce the power consumption during sleep by a factor of 10 so that should be handy.
