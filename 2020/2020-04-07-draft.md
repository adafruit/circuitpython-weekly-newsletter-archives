Hello! Here's the latest Python for Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## CircuitPython 5.1.0 Released

[![CircuitPython 5.1.0 Released](../assets/20200407/featured.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

CircuitPython 5.1.0 stable was released this week by the CircuitPython development team. This is the latest minor revision of CircuitPython and the first 5.1.x stable release. It is identical to 5.1.0-rc.0.

**New features and improvements since 5.0.0**
- ulab, a numpy-like fast vector module: Perform mathematical operations 10-50x as fast as raw CircuitPython. It is enabled on almost all boards except those with samd21 microcontrollers - [Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/ulab-crunch-numbers-fast-with-circuitpython/overview)
- Support for “f-strings”, a more convenient way to build strings dynamically. It is enabled on almost all boards except those with samd21 microcontrollers.
- And many more including two new board definitions.

## Stanford - a free introductory coding course in Python (short deadline)

[![Code in Place: Free coding education](../assets/20200407/20200407stanford.jpg)](https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/announcement/)

As an act of community service, a group of Stanford computer science instructors are coming together to offer their teaching services free of charge for people who want to learn introductory coding, subject to availability. This is a one time offering for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Course Dates: April 13th until May 22nd.
Where: Anywhere with internet.
Who: Learners, with no programming experience, and time to dedicate to learning.
**Student application deadline: April 8th, Anywhere on Earth.**
Teacher application deadline: April 3rd, Anywhere on Earth.

The learning experience, called CS106A - Code in Place, will be an introductory programming course using the Python language, using material from the first half of Stanford University's established intro course, CS106A. It assumes no prior programming experience. You should expect to be working 15 to 20 hours a week and you will need an internet connection strong enough to stream video. Code in Place require no previous background in programming---just a willingness to work hard and a love for learning. It requires considerable dedication and hard work, over a course of 5 weeks.

CircuitPython Weekly Meeting for April 6th, 2020 [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/lRxlsG850d4)

#ICYDNCI What was the most popular, most clicked link, in [last week's newsletter](https://link)? [title](url).

## Made with Mu

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep checking back for download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This week has been as expected more work to migrate our existing Arduino libraries to GitHub Actions. I've largely finished moving everything that was previously on Travis CI so I'm now moving onto the larger remainder of the libraries that had not been under continuous integration. Not having been under CI means that for the most part the remaining libraries either are not documented well or their documentation doesn't use the Doxygen formatting that we use to automagically turn the inline documentation into a nicely formatted webpage that is more easy to browse.

[![Bryan](../assets/20200407/20200407bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

One of the great things about Doxygen is that like other things like Sphinx for Python's docstrings, it forces the code and the documentation for the code to be colocated which makes it easier to keep your docs up to date. Doxygen and similar tools will also give you warnings if your documentation isn't up to snuff or has pieces missing. We use this feature in our CI setup to test the documentation of code that has either been merged or submitted as part of a Pull Request.

**Dan**

I finished the initial BLE pulse oximeter library, and passed it on for use. But pulse oximeters are rare right now due to the Covid19 pandemic, so it may be a while before we can get some more for a project.

I am finishing up the SAMD51 spurious flash writes fix to the UF2 bootloader. The bootloader now waits for the board voltage to be adequate and stable before launching the user program.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20200407/20200407jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Continuing on the theme of Protomatter, the LED matrix library now works with the nRF52840 feather, and is adapted to work with the displayio library.  

A 5.1.0-rc1 is likely, because of a couple of small problems that were reported and fixed in ulab since rc0.  I'll be talking about it with other developers before making a final decision.

**Kattni**

[![Kattni](../assets/20200407/20200407kattni.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Last week, I put together my first [video podcast for the Python on Hardware newsletter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOvTA80aui0&list=PLjF7R1fz_OOXRMjM7Sm0J2Xt6H81TdDev&index=3&t=0s). Previously, Phil and Limor would go through the newsletter on Ask an Engineer and we would post the clip separately to YouTube etc. later in the week. With all the recent changes, Phil and Limor's focus has shifted to Adafruit assisting with the COVID-19 outbreak and they didn't get a chance to go through it during the live stream. So, I was asked to create last week's video afterwards. This week, I was asked to put together the video in time for Ask an Engineer, and the plan is for me to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. If you want an overview of the newsletter each week, check it out. This week: [Python on Hardware Newsletter #76](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WWVYowDg2M&list=PLjF7R1fz_OOXRMjM7Sm0J2Xt6H81TdDev&index=1)!

We have a series of standards to which we hold the CircuitPython libraries. To that end, we have a list of Library Infrastructure Issues on [circuitpython.org/contributing](https://circuitpython.org/contributing) aggregated by our super helpful Adabot script (thanks @sommersoft for all the work on that!). As new products are on hold for now, it's a great time for spring cleaning, so I've been going through the list to get it taken care of. I'm starting with getting Read the Docs issues in order, as there are quite a few. We'll see what's next. The plan is to get through as much as possible. The list will never be empty, but I'll get it as clear as I can. Keep an eye on the list to stay up to date with the progress. 

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20200407/20200407melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week with my guide on adding a board to Blinka in moderation, I made a few improvements to it and it has now been published at https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-blinka.

I finished up with the dashboard re-skin as well. It is currently being reviewed by the graphic designer and will soon be available.

With those projects out of the way, I decided to turn my attention to the circuitpython.org. I went through all the boards and figured out the date that each was added. After that, I added a date sorting feature so that boards could be sorted by the date they were added. This allows you to find the newest boards easily. I also added an RSS feed to easily see any new boards that are added.

**Scott**

Last week I wrapped up the BLE MIDI work. The last outstanding item is to get the BLE MIDI library in the bundle and then it'll be ready for John Park to teach. There are a couple fixes in CircuitPython so we'll release an unstable release to include them.

Since wrapping that up, I'm working on wrapping up the initial low power work. I ran down a number of issues across ports, merged and then had to update the brand new LiteX port. The LiteX port is done by Sean Cross (@xobs) for the Fomu, an FPGA development board. I had fun updating the LiteX port code and then testing on my Fomu. Pretty wild to see CircuitPython on an FPGA which is much more flexible than our normal microcontrollers.

Tomorrow I'll be doing some more thorough tests on the lower power code while it is reviewed. Then, I'll either continue low power work or start poking at the ESP32-S2.

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/20200407/32420helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4 and later versions is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/20200407/32420codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
