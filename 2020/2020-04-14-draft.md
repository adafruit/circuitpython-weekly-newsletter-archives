Hi everyone! It's the latest Python for Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). There is lots to cover, let's get started.

## CircuitPython 5.2.0 release pops out

[![CircuitPython 5.2.0 Released](../assets/20200414/20200414release.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

CircuitPython 5.2.0 went direct to release on April 9th. It features a new port to LiteX, a Python powered hardware description system used to define a soft System on Chip (SoC) that is then loaded into a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). There are a few minor fixes and improvements over 5.1.0 as well - [Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/04/09/circuitpython-5-2-0-released/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/5.2.0).

## ESP32-S2 receives TinyUSB Support

[![ESP32-S2](../assets/20200414/20200414esp32.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The community has been actively working on software support for the ESP32-S2 chip. For CircuitPython, the foundation of porting CircuitPython is [TinyUSB](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) support. CircuitPython lead author Scott Shawcroft held a stream on support last Friday - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zq8RHXVdSI). Over the weekend, a great pop up stream of the Desk of Ladyada demonstrated TinyUSB running on the chip. Huge kudos to Ha Thach for his expert work on TinyUSB.

This work paves the way for further work porting CircuitPython to this new chip - [Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/04/12/we-are-back-deskofladyada-all-about-the-esp32-s2-by-espressif-systems-adafruit-espressifsystem-esp32s2-get-it-on-digkey/) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/gdkvf2nxx20).

Adafruit is planning products based on the ESP32-S2 chip but has no ETA, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic. Adafruit recommends Digi-Key, who is open and stocking various ESP32-S2  and Adafruit products - [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/products/en/rf-if-and-rfid/rf-transceiver-modules/872?k=ESP32-S2&pkeyword=&sv=0&sf=0&FV=-8%7C872&quantity=&ColumnSort=0&page=1&pageSize=25).

## Adafruit Submitting Board Designs to OSHWA

[![Adafruit Boards and OSHWA](../assets/20200414/20200414oshwa.jpg)](https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html?q=Adafruit)

Adafruit has always been an open source hardware company, predating the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) certification process. With availability of personnel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Adafruit has been submitting their board designs to OSHWA to receive their official certification. This includes a large number of CircuitPython compatible boards - [Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/04/08/25-adafruit-boards-have-been-certified-by-oshwa-oshw-oshwa-adafruit-ohsummit/).

Some of the CircuitPython compatible boards which have received certification to date:

* [Adafruit Feather M4 Express](https://certification.oshwa.org/us000242.html)
* [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express](https://certification.oshwa.org/us000246.html)
* [Adafruit Metro M4 Express AirLift](https://certification.oshwa.org/us000245.html)
* [Adafruit PyPortal](https://certification.oshwa.org/us000248.html)

See the growing list of certified boards and expect more soon - [OSHWA](https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html?q=Adafruit).

## The NFC Copy Cat Cybersecurity Tool

[![NFC Copy Cat](../assets/20200414/20200414cat1.jpg)](https://electroniccats.com/blog/nfc-copy-cat-the-new-cybersecurity-tool-for-nfc-and-magspoof/)

Electronic Cats announced Monday their latest CircuitPython-based electronics board: the NFC Copy Cat. It works by reading or emulating a NFC card; depending on the necessities of the researcher. Using the board, the user will have a device capable of storing magnetic stripe data or NFC payment data to be replayed later — known in the cybersecurity world as a replay attack. This is the first cybersecurity tool that support CircuitPython - [Electronic Cats](https://electroniccats.com/blog/nfc-copy-cat-the-new-cybersecurity-tool-for-nfc-and-magspoof/).

## Microcontroller Bootloader Files are now on CircuitPython.org

[![CircuitPython for Adafruit IO](../assets/20200414/20200414bootloader.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

The CircuitPython website, [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/), now contains links to bootloader files for microcontroller boards. This simplifies users obtaining the latest bootloader file rather than searching on GitHub ([example](https://github.com/adafruit/uf2-samdx1/releases/tag/v3.9.0)). At CircuitPython.Org/downloads, select the board of interest, and find the bootloader information - [Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/04/13/uf2-bootloader-news-downloads-in-circuitpython-org-new-version-for-samd51-m4-boards/) and [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/downloads).

## An Important UF2 Bootloader Update for SAMD51 M4 Boards

A new version of the UF2 bootloader is available for SAMD51 M4 boards, such as the Metro M4 Express, Feather M4 Express, ItsyBitsy M4 Express, PyPortal, PyGamer, PyBadge, and others. Version v3.9.0 or later fixes a rare but annoying problem that occasionally erases parts of internal flash memory when the board is plugged in or power-cycled. Both Arduino and CircuitPython are affected. Adafruit highly recommends that you update your bootloader if you have a SAMD51 M4 board. Download the updater from the circuitpython.org/downloads page for your board, and follow the instructions to update. Update instructions will also be added to the Adafruit Learning System Guide for each board - [Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/04/13/uf2-bootloader-news-downloads-in-circuitpython-org-new-version-for-samd51-m4-boards/).

## The CircuitPython Library for Adafruit IO is Updated

[![CircuitPython for Adafruit IO](../assets/20200414/20200414aio.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_AdafruitIO)

Adafruit_CircuitPython_AdafruitIO is the CircuitPython wrapper library for communicating with Adafruit IO, the Internet of Things service. Version 3.1.3 adds a check with the Python formater Black. Looking for an ultra easy way to use Internet of Things (IoT) logging and display with PCircuitPython on microcontrollers or single board computers, Adafruit IO is for you with both free and paid tiers. Ones data is never sold or given out and it can be deleted whenever you want. - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_AdafruitIO/releases/tag/3.1.3) and [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/).

## Adafruit Update

[![Adafruit Heart New York](../assets/03312020/03312020heart.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/03/22/covid/)

Adafruit Industries continues to run with 100% of employees being paid and continuing to work. Most are working remotely, with some working in the Manhattan, New York factory as an essential service and business under NYC Executive Order 202.6 Capabilities. Adafruit was deemed an essential service to distribute/make some PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) such as face shields, and manufacturer electronics for essential life-saving/preserving equipment and development which is needed in New York and beyond. -[Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/03/22/covid/)

Adafruit received a literal ton of plastic for face shields from food packaging company Novolex. The material was put to use making face masks on an Adafruit assembly line.

Note: Stanford states:

> We were expecting hundreds, maybe as many as a thousand students. But people told their friends and we had an astounding 80,000 people who started an application. We were able to support 8,000 students, which is a small fraction of how many we would have liked. 

## Made with Mu

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20200414/32420blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **224**!

This week I've been continuing to migrate our Libraries to GitHub Actions. Currently at about 50 done out of the first cohort of 130, though there are likely others waiting in the wings as well. In the interest of maintaining my sanity I've started interleaving work on the Actions migration with work on hardware and drivers.

On that note I've started work on the LIS3DH library to bring it up to our current standards and start making room for new sensors. The [H3LIS331DL](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/h3lis331dl.html) and [LIS331DH](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lis331hh.html) from ST are next up and are very close to the LIS3DH so I'm refactoring the LIS3DH library to pull the common code bits into a shared base class, and then making subclasses for each of the sensor types to handle differences like measurement range and data rate.

Refactoring your code is the process of changing how your code is structured to improve how things are organized to make it more maintainable and to prepare it for later additions. It's a useful and necessary step when you're writing code because as a general rule, the choices you previously made about how the code should be organize no longer hold up. If you _don't_ refactor your code, you're liable to end up with code that is generally bad by just about every measure.

I finished the SAMD51 spurious flash writes fix to the UF2 bootloader and released it. But! - In the process I broke the SAMD21 bootloader updater, even though I thought I had tested it! So I reworked that code and will be making another bootloader release shortly.

Since we want to make it easy for users to update their bootloaders, I added a new bootloader download section on each board page in circuitpython.org now. It includes short instructions about how to update. This makes [circuitpython.org](http://circuitpython.org/) even more of a one-stop shop for downloads now.

This week I contributed some improvements to ulab, and next I need to pull those changes into CircuitPython before we make our next release.

On the Protomatter / LCD front, I've worked on improving error handling, because it has very specific requirements for the pins that can be used.  There's also at least one last memory usage bug, which has to be squashed before it can be included in CircuitPython.

I also uploaded the little "feet" I've been using to stand up my LED modules to thingiverse -- use 2 or 3 of these and create a nice desk stand for these modules: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4270499

This week, I've continued working on the library infrastructure issues. Along the way, I've found some issues with our script called Adabot that generates the list of issues. The major issue wasn't a problem with Adabot, it was a change in the way a check worked, but it meant that we had a check that was triggering on every library when in fact none of them were failing. I worked with Sommersoft to get some updates applied to Adabot to fix that and a couple of other issues. We'll continue to update Adabot over time to ensure the checks on the library infrastructure page provide a place to find useful ways to contribute in the clearest way possible.

When we updated Pylint and implemented Black, we forgot to add the Black check to the continuous integration. So, we ran a patch to add the check to all the libraries and promptly found that there was an issue with the way Black had been applied to most of the libraries. It turns out if you don't specify a "target version" of Python to Black, it tries to guess what version of Python you meant to use based on the file. We are targeting Python 3.5, but there was at least one file that had enough Python-2-type code in it, that Black assumed we wanted to target Python 2. So, when we added the check to the libraries targeting Python 3.5, the check failed. So, I'm currently going through nearly every library and rerunning the Black formatter with the proper Python version, and creating PRs for the updates. If you're able, please consider reviewing some of these relatively simple PRs. Thanks!

This past week I finished up the Web Bluetooth Dashboard Re-skin and updated [the associated learning guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-dashboard-web-bluetooth-chrome).

I also updated the SPI driver in Blinka to use ioctl and is written in Python, so it doesn't rely on the SpiDev driver, which is not available on every platform. This allows SPI to be more accessible on more boards and operating systems.

After that, I started another attempt to get the Onion Omega2+ working on Blinka and have been having more success so far. GPIO is working and next up is to try and get I2C, SPI, and UART working.

This last week has been further testing of my initial lower power changes. It's been an exercise in finding things that I thought worked but don't. So, I've been bug finding across the platforms such as STM or iMX RT. Getting really close with it. Jeff and Dan both have reviewed it. I've also done reviews on Jeff's upcoming RGB display work.

In the next week, I'll be releasing 5.2.0-beta.0 and the lower power work and rgb display stuff will be released in a subsequent beta. So, keep testing the new stuff and let us know if you find issues.

After that, I'll either start working on ESP32-S2 testing and/or USB reverse engineering for a fever scanner. I'll likely stream it so make sure you are subscribed to Adafruit on Twitch and YouTube. Join the Discord too!

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/20200414/32420helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4 and later versions is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
