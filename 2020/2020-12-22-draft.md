## GitHub now supports MOV and MP4 video

[![GitHub supports MOV and MP4](../assets/20201222/20201222video.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/12/18/github-now-supports-mov-and-mp4-github-this-is-great/)

GitHub now supports MOV and MP4 with a maximum size of 10Mb. Being able to share screencasts’, wiring, step by step, and use video in documentation is something we do wherever we can, and now it’s part of GitHub. With video now part of GitHub we’ll be able to document better, share more, and have more content that helps people.

Communities can also use video to tell their story, maximize social coding together, and really enhance anything that is on GitHub. - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/12/18/github-now-supports-mov-and-mp4-github-this-is-great/)

## Brain interpretation of code

[![Brain interpretation of code](../assets/20201222/20201222brain.jpg)](https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215)

To the brain, reading computer code is not the same as reading language. Neuroscientists find that interpreting code activates a general-purpose brain network, but not language-processing centers. The two programming languages that the researchers focused on in this study are known for their readability — Python and ScratchJr - [MIT News](https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This week I’ve been working with the SCD30 from Sensirion, a NDIR (Non-Dispersive InfraRed) C02 sensor module with temperature and humidity measurements provided by an additional onboard sensor. As previously discussed, this NIDR sensor is basically an optics lab that you can carry in the palm of your hand! Some cursory search (AKA a single Google query) suggests that CO2 sensors tend to cost anywhere from around $100 to as much as $1000 or more. While the final price of the Adafruit SCD30 offering will depend on the costs associated with offering it for sale, It’s likely that it will cost significantly less than the $100 price point. As always, I’m excited to see what new and interesting uses the Adafruit community will find for the SCD30, especially given the role CO2 plays for living things.

CO2 level is often used as an indirect measure of air quality since buildup of CO2 within an environment will happen when there is poor ventilation of a space, and the waste CO2 produced by humans collects instead of being removed. With poor ventilation other airborne hazards will also build up to potentially dangerous levels. Mold, carbon monoxide, air pollution from cooking, and most importantly farts and cat litter box stink are generally not things that you want to be breathing in. Air quality and ventilation are especially relevant now given what is known about the COVID-19 transmission risks associated with indoor spaces.

As a personal project, I’m hoping to use the SCD30 to measure how the CO2 levels in my Dubia Roach enclosure change over time, with the intent to use it as a proxy for the metabolism of the colony as a whole. I’ve considered attaching small masks to the roaches to measure metabolism directly, however that approach seems challenging and given the availability of the SCD30, perhaps not necessary for now. 

**Dan**

I finished implementing persistent memory that is maintained during CircuitPython deep sleep. This has been merged into the main branch. I'm finishing up a guide to sleep and alarms: it just needs a few demo videos. I will be reviewing and testing Scott's support for pin alarms soon.

There were some BLE regressions in 6.x CircuitPython, so I'll be debugging these over the next few days.

Jeff and I worked on getting the CircuitPython code base to compile with the latest ARM gcc toolchain, which is now based on gcc 10. There were some changes in what's done for certain optimization levels, and we had to tune these settings to avoid overflowing flash on some builds. There is also improved error-checking in gcc 10: it detected some code bugs that we have fixed.

**Jeff**

I had a couple of guides published in the Learn system last week. While there's only a little Python in it, I'm most excited about the [diy lofi hip hop raspberry pi radio with braincraft hat](https://learn.adafruit.com/lofi-hip-hop-raspberry-pi-radio-braincraft).

[![Jeff](../assets/20201222/20201222jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Another big development is the addition of support for "pcf" format fonts to adafruit_bitmap_font. These fonts load several times faster than "bdf" format fonts, and are also somewhat smaller on disk.

[![Jeff](../assets/20201222/20201222jeff2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

**Kattni**

This week I added the QT Py to the CircuitPython Essentials guide.  A lot of basic CircuitPython examples rely on the D13 LED, which isn't present on the QT Py hardware. So for those examples, I included a wiring diagram showing how to wire up an LED to the QT Py, and updated the examples to include code for the external LED. Everything worked as expected except the Storage example, which fails to work on the latest CircuitPython, 6.1.0-beta.2. I filed a bug for that, but the issue may be a feature, and we may have to reconsider how we do that example for the future. We'll find out!

**Lucian**

This past week I've been working on the TCP Server API, implementing the Socket functions Bind(), Listen() and Accept() and corresponding test programs. These functions are used when creating a server on the ESP32-S2, which can accept connections from other devices and return data to them.

I've found a number of resources useful while working on the socket API, but none more useful than [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#intro). To anyone looking to understand more about what's going on with the ESP32-S2 network development, it's an informative (and entertaining) place to start. 

Outside of sockets, I've been continuing to prowl around other bugs on the ESP32-S2 core modules, including continuing issues with Analog and the Neopixel. While we've gotten important fixes in, such as the memory leak in the AnalogIO code, we're still seeing some issues reported, so I'll be tackling those this week as well.

This week I finished up the Web Serial ESPTool and wrote up a guide page for using it. Web Serial ESPTool is an online tool that uses Web Serial to directly communicate with the ESP chips without needing to install any additional software besides the chrome browser. You can find the guide page [in our MagTag guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-magtag/web-serial-esptool) or [Metro ESP32-S2 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-esp32-s2/web-serial-esptool).

After that was finished, I wrote up a guide on creating new projects for the MagTag. The guide goes through the different layers and a couple of code examples including one that uses deep sleep. You can find the guide [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/creating-magtag-projects-with-circuitpython).

This week I've been wrapping up pin level alarms. It's mostly working but there are some weird bugs. I made a PR to get other eyes on it. After this I'm taking a break from the S2 features, may tackle some bugs or experiment with new things of interest. It should be a fun next few weeks amongst the holidays. I hope everyone has a good holiday season.

On January 1st, we'll launch #circuitpython2021 where we hope to hear from all of our community members about what you'd like to see CircuitPython do. We'll all post as well. So, start brainstorming what 2021 can bring to making things with CircuitPython.
