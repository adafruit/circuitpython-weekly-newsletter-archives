## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This week I made some updates to the CAN Bus Feather Wing and sent it off to the fine folks at OSH Park and OSH Stencils. I’m looking forward to working on this as there are lots of interesting applications for an interface for talking with CAN Bus. One of the most common places you’ll find a CAN bus is in your car itself. 

My car for example, a 2009 VW Rabbit has a pretty interesting network that connects all the different control modules (ECUs) that allow it to have all the features that make it an old but still relatively modern car. Keyless locks, power windows, radio, indicator lights, and even the engine all talk with each other through a CAN Bus powered network, allowing you to do fun things like rolling down the windows using the key fob. I’m excited to listen to this bus to see how the different parts are talking to each other. Keep in mind that if I had one I would with near certainty be voiding my car’s warranty, and there is of course always the chance of irreparable damage to the car.

My immediate goal is to be able to read OBD2 diagnostic information that is mandated  to be available on modern cars, at least in the US. Being an older and “aggressively loved” car that is long in the tooth, my Rabbit is no stranger to throwing codes (AKA Check Engine Lights) that would prevent me from passing a smog check. Fortunately, if you can read it there is a good amount of information available from the car that can help troubleshoot issues. Unfortunately you need a dedicated piece of hardware to be able to read the diagnostic codes from the car.

**Dan**

I'm continuing work on the ATT (attribute) protocol for HCI \_bleio. Currently I’m working on the code to populate the attribute table. The information in the attribute table is passed to a peer who wants to find out all the details of the services provided by a BLE device. This process is called "discovery". Once I have the attribute table set up, I can then implement the code that passes back the detail to the peer.

I just changed our CircuitPython builds so they upload the mpy-cross executables they build to a central place. We build executables for x64 Linux, Raspbian, Windows, and MacOS. These executables will now be easier to find.

With a logic analyzer, I got some timing data for the NeoPixel write operations for Adafruit's Arduino library and CircuitPython, on both SAMD21 and SAMD51 processors. Some non-standard NeoPixel-like RGB LED's were not working properly on CircuitPython but did work on Arduino, and this data will help us understand why.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20200804/20200804jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The bulk of my time has gone into a new guide which will cover both the SD card improvements in CircuitPython 6, as well as the new SD card breakout that supports SDIO. As a part of this, I have continued to prepare support for the SD card slot on the STM32F405 Feather, which requires SDIO.  Other work includes pulling in updates to microlab and investigating adding the "LSB first" mode to busio.SPI.

**Kattni**

This week, I created a many more fritzing objects for upcoming Adafruit products. This will continue as we work through a huge backlog of products, since production was put on hold during the initial stages of COVID.

One of the updated breakouts was the STEMMA QT version of the VL53L0X. I updated the guide to reflect the new version with a new Overview page, updated Pinouts page, updated fritzing diagrams, and new schematic and fab prints on the Downloads page. 

Next up is updating the BME680 guide with the STEMMA QT version, the same way I updated the VL53L0X. As well, I have a fairly long list of miscellaneous to attend to between other major things. The busy continues!

**Lucian**

[![Lucian](../assets/20200804/20200804lucian.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week I worked on implementing the Neopixel and the PulseIn/PulseOut module combo on ESP32-S2, diving into the RMT (remote control) peripheral. Espressif has a funny habit of naming their peripherals in a way that makes them sound kind of limited, when the truth is just the opposite - just as the "LED Controller" is actually an extremely flexible and general purpose PWM controller that is also suitable for servos and tones, the "Remote Control" peripheral is capable of far more than just IR pulse trains (such as emulating the Neopixel protocol). I'm currently considering whether I should implement a port-level mediator system for the RMT, since it's possible we may also want to use it for things like RotaryIO, in which case it'd be good to have a similar channel-negotiator system like the one I implemented on the STM32.

Over the weekend, I also took some time to play with the Open Book Featherwing from Oddly Specific Objects. I've always enjoyed playing with language learning software/hardware and saw an opportunity to do something along those lines on the Open Book, which is a compact e-paper ereader that runs on Circuitpython via the Feather M4 Express (or presumably other feathers, I haven't checked yet). The really cool thing about the Open Book is that it has a NOR flash chip called Babel that is entirely dedicated to unicode character support - this is useful since good international embedded fonts are kind of hard to find and have a hard time fitting on the Feather 2MB NOR flash alongside Circuitpython.

Shown below is my flash card app, which assembles random Japanese sentences from a json file full of "cards" and "words", allowing you to make many variations of a particular sentence type. For instance, if you'd like to study conjugated verbs, you can design a card that will create many different sentences that focus on this topic but use different words and structures for variation. I'm hoping to expand on it to include tags and SRS features - it's been really cool how easy it was to move a python app designed on a PC over to Circuitpython! 

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20200804/20200804melissa.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week, I worked on the Matrix Portal library and wrote a couple of examples that will hopefully be used in some future projects. One of the examples displayed a scrolling message of YouTube subscriber and view counts for a given channel. This was based on a similar project done on the PyPortal with some changes for the lower resolution.

Another example displayed the current bitcoin price. This one was pretty simple in that the library initialized the display and WiFi connections and went out to the internet to get the price and display it. This was similar to another PyPortal example that did the same thing.

I'm still working on changing up the library so only certain components of it can be used and thus it will use less memory.

**Scott**

Last week I spent some time testing a PyPortal project with the refined requests library and following up on PRs from the week before. I also switched over to a desktop with Arch linux for development.

On Friday during my stream I verified ESP pinouts with my feather adapter and ordered v3 for testing. More confident with choosing pinouts for Adafruit designs.

This week I'm focussed on native wifi on the -S2. I've got the scanning and connection API done in shared-bindings and am starting to hook it to the IDF. Running into some linking issues due to bringing in the wifi stack. Good to sort out now. WIP branch is https://github.com/tannewt/circuitpython/tree/native_wifi Check out my streams for the latest progress!

Outside of CircuitPython, in my evenings, my interest in system on a chip (SoC) design has been renewed by the OrangeCrab, a feather form factor FPGA board, and the open PDK announcement from Google. I've been experimenting with nMigen, a Python powered hardware description library, to create "gateware" for the OrangeCrab.

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/20200804/codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
