## Sony Publishes a Guide to CircuitPython on their Spresense Board

[![CircuitPython on Spresense Guide](../assets/20201215/20201215sony.jpg)](https://developer.sony.com/posts/circuitpython-is-now-available-for-spresense/)

Sony has just released a new [getting started guide](https://developer.sony.com/develop/spresense/docs/circuitpython_set_up_en.html) to help developers program their Spresense microcontroller board with CircuitPython.

> Python developers will feel familiar with the way to program Spresense. After the initial set-up for Spresense, there is no need for any extra desktop development environment tools. Use your favorite text editor to start developing. The new getting started guide helps set up Spresense for CircuitPython in a matter of minutes in a step-by-step fashion. All CircuitPython libraries have example code to help you kick-start your programming.

Sony plans to continue expanding the guide with tutorials, featuring unique Spresense features and capabilities when using CircuitPython. You can get Spresense updates via [Sony’s Developer World on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SonyDevWorld) - [Sony Blog](https://developer.sony.com/posts/circuitpython-is-now-available-for-spresense/), [Guide](https://developer.sony.com/develop/spresense/docs/circuitpython_set_up_en.html), and [Developer Site](https://developer.sony.com/develop/spresense).

Expansion in the Python community has brought new challenges and opportunities to improve the global community. In order to further the PSF’s mission to ‘support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers’, the Python Software Foundation announced the launch of the Diversity and Inclusion Workgroup (D&I workgroup) - [Python Blog](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/12/announcing-psf-diversity-and-inclusion.html)

## Piunora: Designing a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 Carrier and CircuitPython

[![Deep Dive with Scott](../assets/20201215/20201215scott2.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SlD2dLHkbPg?t=3918)

[Timon on Twitter](https://twitter.com/timonsku/status/1337134272625467392) posts a very different concept: Piunora. A carrier for the Raspberry Pi CM4 in an Adafruit Metro/
Arduino form-factor. It features full-size HDMI, USB-C (data+power), USB-A, M.2 (PCI-E), RGB LEDs, 6xADC, Button, camera connector and a Qwiic/Stemma QT - [Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/timonsku/status/1337134272625467392).

> I got the idea from tannewt (Scott Shawcroft) and at first thought it was a bit silly but in reality this offers some major benefits compared to the standard RPI4 when we are looking at this from an electronics dev board perspective. This enables something really cool and what I intend for this to be the primary application and that is CircuitPython by mounting the Pi as a USB gadget instead of a host device. So you can develop on the Pi like you would with a normal MCU dev board directly on your PC!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This week I've been working with the SCD30 NDIR eCO2 sensor from those fine sensing folks at Sensirion, who take their sensing very seriously. Looking at the SCD30 you can immediately tell that this is not like most other sensors, at least the ones we normally see. The NDIR I mentioned stands for "NonDispersive InfraRed" which signifies that the SCD30 uses infrared spectroscopy to measure the CO2 in its environment.

[![Bryan](../assets/20201215/20201215bryan1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

In essence, the SCD30 measures the amount of CO2 by shining IR light into the sample measurement area and measuring the amount of light within a narrow wavelength band corresponding to what is absorbed by CO2.  You've basically got a little optics lab built into a breakout! In case you were on the fence, I'm pretty sure this is confirmation that we're living in the future.

[![Bryan](../assets/20201215/20201215bryan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

In other news, the hot tip from sources on Varick street is that nearly every sensor manufacturer just released a revision of one of their sensors in the last month or so, which means... more sensor breakouts! Expect to see some more sensors headed your way over the next month or so, and if that doesn't _move_ you, perhaps some of the boards we're eyeing for after the current batch of sensors will do that for you!

**Dan**

I am working on adding persistent memory to CircuitPython that is maintained even during deep sleep. This is not flash, which could wear out if you wrote it too often, but a special section of low-power RAM. Its contents go away if power is removed completely, but otherwise it survives through all kinds of sleep.

I am also writing an introductory guide to the new sleep and alarm capabilities.

We thought there might have been an issue with the ADC battery monitoring on the MagTag.  I did several checks, including comparing with an external ADC, and instrumenting the ADC code to check the raw values, and all that appeared to be OK. A simple change to the MagTag library fixed the problem.

**Jeff**

I've been putting the finishing touches on a guide for creating your own pogo-pin jig.

[![Jeff](../assets/20201215/20201215jeff1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I'm also excited that the long awaited Fether M4 CAN is in the store; several months ago I wrote the code that allows this functionality to be used from CircuitPython.

[![Jeff](../assets/20201215/20201215jeff2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Cheerlights Holiday Wreath with Animations](https://learn.adafruit.com/cheerlights-led-animations) guide. [Cheerlights](https://cheerlights.com/about/) is an IoT project that allows folks to sync up LED colors across the world by sending a message on Twitter. I took it one step further, and instead of simply lighting up the LEDs, it displays a different LED animation for each color. This project uses the Adafruit MagTag and a NeoPixel strip - no soldering required. Whether you're familiar with Cheerlights, or new to it entirely, this project is a fun and festive way to display different LED animations.

[![Kattni](../assets/20201215/20201215kattni.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I updated the [SGP30 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-sgp30-gas-tvoc-eco2-mox-sensor) to feature the new STEMMA QT version of the breakout, as well as starting the guide for the next generation, the SGP40. 

I also started the guide for the new [Feather M4 CAN Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4759) board. If you're looking to learn all the details about your new Feather CAN board, keep an eye out for this guide.

**Lucian**

This week I fixed a couple of bugs that popped up in the ESP32S2 port, including a memory leak that was occurring in AnalogIO and some continuing effort towards fixing the reset system for individual pins. I also helped to investigate other issues with the ESP32S2's ADC, relating to calibration behavior when measuring near the min or max voltages, which were impacting battery readings on the MagTag.

I've also been working on completing PWMOut on the i.MX. As with most of the common-hal modules that use "sets" of peripherals, a lot of it is just creating a reservation system that prevents you from picking PWM drivers on the chip that are already in use, and then testing for bugs. It's been a bit of a slog, since NXP's examples and drivers are very tied to the idea that you've designed your whole system before compiling (ST's HAL has similar limitations). But with Circuitpython, your whole program is always designed at runtime, so there's a lot of wading through enums, macros and tables in order to get things working smoothly. 

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on a couple fairly major projects. The first thing I did was create a Unified Portal library which I called PortalBase. The intention of it is to hold the common functions for the Portal libraries such as MagTag, MatrixPortal, and both PyPortal libraries. That way if we find a bug in one of them it doesn't require 4 or more fixes. I ended up writing that and also porting the MagTag library over to use it. The port went well and any scripts that use the MagTag library require no changes in order to use it. I'd like to port over the other libraries in the next couple of weeks and will hopefully get similar results.

The other major project that I worked on was adding stub loading functionality to the Web Serial ESPTool. The way that stub loading works is it takes some binary data - called stub code - and writes it into the RAM of the ESP32-S2 and then sends a command to run that stub code. Once I was able to get a good "Hello" response from the stub that was running, it became much easier. The stub code basically listens for some extended commands that are not available by default on the ESP32-S2. This allowed some additional functions such as erasing the entire flash and programming files that are larger than 2MB.

This week I picked up deep sleep from Dan. We got my first pull request merged that reorganized sleep internally so that it would shut everything down gracefully before sleeping. It also changed the pretend deep sleep to behave more like real deep sleep. (We pretend to deep sleep when USB data is connected so it's easy to iterate on code that deep sleeps.) Now, boards can be init and *deinit* to shut down board circuitry while asleep.

Once done with that, I jumped right into adding PinAlarm support. It allow you to sleep until the value on a pin is either high or low. This allows the code to wake on button press or interrupt from a sensor. It's more dynamic sleep than what one can do with time based alarms. I've gotten it mostly working but need to fix a few bugs before making a PR.
