## The CircuitPython subreddit hits 1,000 users

[![r/circuitpython](../assets/20200811/20200811reddit.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/08/06/the-circuitpython-subreddit-hits-1000-members-circuitpython-python-reddit-circuitpython-adafruit/)

The [CircuitPython subreddit on Reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/circuitpython/) crossed the 1,000 members mark this past week! Thank you to Reddit readers for choosing to get a Python fix on this subreddit.

Adafruit is dedicated to providing the news on Python and CircuitPython in ones chosen way. Whether via [Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=python), [Newsletter](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/), [Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjF7R1fz_OOXRMjM7Sm0J2Xt6H81TdDev), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/adafruit/channel/), or on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/circuitpython/), it's there - [Adafruit Blog]() and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/circuitpython/).

## A pip user experience survey

[![pip survey](../assets/20200811/20200811pip.jpg)](https://tools.simplysecure.org/survey/index.php?r=survey/index&sid=827389&lang=en)

The Python package manager (pip) team is working to improve the usability of pip, for **all** users. Right now, a lot of what pip does can be confusing and complicated for people who are not Python experts. The team's objective is to understand how to improve that.

You can read about the work on the [Python Software Foundation website](https://wiki.python.org/psf/Pip2020DonorFundedRoadmap) and can hear about the work on [this Python podcast](https://testandcode.com/124).

Right now, the team wants to speak with users about the following topics:

- Who uses pip?
- How do users' disabilities affect their usage of pip?
- How does pip documentation help users?
- What pip functionality is important to users?
- What problems do people have with pip? And how can we improve it for them?

They're interested in speaking with people of all levels of Python experience.

They can't stress enough - you don't need to be a programming expert to take part. In fact they are specifically looking to hear from those who are not programmers. They're looking for diverse users to take part in the research - if you use pip they are interested in hearing from you.

If you're interested in speaking with the team about your experiences, the first thing to do is to [sign up for UX Studies](https://tools.simplysecure.org/survey/index.php?r=survey/index&sid=827389&lang=en).

## Open Source at Google

[![Open Source at Google](../assets/20200811/20200811google1.jpg)](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/08/open-source-by-numbers-at-google.html)

[![Open Source at Google](../assets/20200811/20200811google2.jpg)](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/08/open-source-by-numbers-at-google.html)

A summary of the contributions Google has provided to Open Source Software:

> At Google, open source is at the core of our infrastructure, processes, and culture. As such, participation in these communities is vital to our productivity. Within OSPO (Open Source Programs Office), our mission is to bring the value of open source to Google and the resources of Google to open source. To ensure our actions match our commitment, in this post we will explore a variety of metrics intended to increase context, transparency, and accountability across all of the communities we engage with.

They state that their intentions are twofold: give back to the communities they depend on as well as expand support for open source overall. Google firmly believes in open source and its ability to bring together users, contributors, and companies alike to deliver better software - [Google Open Source Blog](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/08/open-source-by-numbers-at-google.html).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

The last week was short for me thanks to a much-needed camping trip to my favorite sea-side campground. Alas I don't have any spectacular pictures to show, so a picture of my dog impatiently anticipating our arrival will have to suffice:

[![Bryan](../assets/20200811/20200811bryan1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The remainder of my week saw me bouncing between a few tasks, but mostly focused on the MS8607 Pressure, Temperature, and Humidity (PHT) sensor from TE Connectivity. Because of their many applications, PHT sensors are a common offering from companies making sensors. This one is no different, and does an admirable job of measuring a wide range of all three environmental conditions. Each and every MS8607 sensor is calibrated at the factory and the calibration constants stored in the sensor itself.

As with other sensors with integrated calibration data, one of the most challenging parts of the driver writing process is implementing the algorithm used to convert the calibration constants into corrections to be applied to the raw sensor data. Here is the fun flow chart for applying corrections to the pressure and temperature data:

[![Bryan](../assets/20200811/20200811bryan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

As I write this I'm finishing up the Arduino library and have finished the CircuitPython library. Once I wrap this up, I'll hopefully be moving onto assembling and testing the CAN Bus FeatherWing that's been sitting on my bench while I wrap up a handful of sensors.

[![Bryan](../assets/20200811/20200811bryan3.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

**Dan**

I'm still doing the ATT (attribute) protocol implementation for HCI \_bleio. I've got service discovery working, and am finishing up characteristic and descriptor discovery. The next step after that is to implement read and write for characteristics, and to do characteristic notification. Once that is done I'll have all the pieces in place for Bluefruit Connect app to be able to talk over BLE to a board using an HCI BLE adapter, like the M4 Airlift or the PyPortal. Things are going smoothly and I'm looking forward to that end goal.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20200811/20200811jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

At the moment, I'm working on bringing the Sharp Memory Display forward into the world of displayio.  Right now you can already use these displays --both this large 2.7 inch 400x240 one and the 1.3 inch 144x168 one -- in CircuitPython, but you have to use an older "framebuf" API for interacting with them.  With the new support, it will work just like other black and white displays, with text, bitmaps and shapes all supported.  In addition to doing the coding, there will be a new page in the Sharp Memory Display guide showing you how to get started.

**Kattni**

I updated the BME680 and 0.96" OLED display guides to feature the STEMMA QT version, assisted with the ICM20948 guide, and started the guide for the ST25DV16K.

I created a few more Fritzing objects. Check out the Adafruit Fritzing Library for a sneak peek at some future products.

I created a new role on the Adafruit Discord server - the PCB Helpers role - and invited three community members who were already quite active in the #pcb-design channel to join the role. All three accepted. If you have questions about PCB design, these folks are here to help.

I also took some time to take care of some miscellaneous things that needed to be done. There are plenty of things that are taking priority, but ensuring that I'm keeping up with the misc. is equally important.

This week I worked on wrapping up testing for the Neopixel and implementing PulseIn and PulseOut on the ESP32-S2. Both have been fairly straightforward, since the ESP32 architecture has a dedicated pulse control peripheral for creating and decoding pulse trains. Interestingly, the trickiest part of the implementation has been working around assumptions within Circuitpython that a peripheral with these capabilities does *not* exist - PulseOut, for example, assumes that the implementation will need to bit-bang a PWM output up and down, and thus requires a PWM peripheral object as a parameter despite a dedicated pulse transmitter like the RMT not needing one. Thus, we've started thinking about a number of API changes to work through these assumptions, and even breaking PWMOut from PulseIO completely into its own module, PWMIO. I'll be planning out these changes more this coming week once PulseIn and PulseOut enter PR review.

This past week, I mainly focused on refactoring the MatrixPortal library and finished that up. I had originally taken the PyPortal library as a single file and modified it to work with the RGB Matrix shield and Metro M4 Airlift Lite board. While it worked, it did require loading everything, which could be a bit memory intensive. With the refactoring, it is able to be used with just the portions you need, though the original ease of use from before refactoring is still present that ties everything together.

I also worked on testing some changes to the PiTFT install script that were done by Ladyada. I wanted to make sure that it was still working on each display. There were only a few minor issues that I found during testing and those were promptly fixed, so everything is working great with the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS.

This week I've been plugging away at adding Wifi support to the ESP32-S2. I've got network scanning working and connecting working. Next up is adding the socket APIs used to perform all sorts of internety things. Will also add ping to make debugging easier. The file system seems flakier so I'll likely need to debug that at some point too.

In my evenings I've continued to poke at Python FPGA stuff and made further progress on hooking everything up. I'm now working on testing it to make sure everything is hooked up right.
