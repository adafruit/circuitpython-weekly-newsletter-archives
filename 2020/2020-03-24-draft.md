## CircuitPython libraries are now using the latest Pylint and Black formatting!

[![CircuitPython Library Checking](../assets/03242020/03242020pylint.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/03/17/circuitpython-libraries-are-now-using-the-latest-pylint-and-black-formatting/)

Adafruit has completed updated every CircuitPython library to use the latest version of Pylint and implemented the Black Python formatter. Pylint is a tool for linting code. Linting is the process of checking your code for basic stylistic mistakes. It doesn’t verify that your code works, it simply checks that it looks as good as possible and is readable by others. Black is a really useful code formatting tool maintained by the Python Software Foundation. It reformats files to improve readability. When you contribute code to CircuitPython libraries, your code will be checked for both. You’ll be able to make any fixes at that point, but it’s much easier to set up Pylint and Black on your machine and run them locally.

We have a guide to help! The [Improve Your Code with Pylint and Black guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/improve-your-code-with-pylint) was recently updated to include installation and usage of Black, as well as to reflect the update to the latest Pylint. You are no longer required to specify a particular version of Pylint or Python to be able to check your code locally. The process should be much simpler now. Check out the guide and you’ll be up and running in no time! - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/03/17/circuitpython-libraries-are-now-using-the-latest-pylint-and-black-formatting/)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/03242020/32420blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

This week I'm working on the breakout for the DS1841 Temperature-Controlled, Non-Volatile I2C Logarithmic Resistor from Maxim. This chip is super cool. It's intended purpose is to provide temperature compensated bias control for avalanche photodiodes (APDs) used in optical transceivers. They're new to me, but apparently APDs are commonly used because they have a high sensitivity and wide bandwidth at the cost of being sensitive to temperature fluctuations. This chip can help with that! You can check out [this app note](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/1/1831.html) if you want to learn a bit more about APDs.

While most of us don't have a private fiber optic network with fussy APDs, the DS1841 has enough bells and whistles that I'm sure you'll be able to find a use for it in a project. It's basically an I2C controller potentiometer with a logarithmic curve, so you can use it in place of a mechanical log potentiometer to allow you to control it programmatically. Furthermore, the temperature compensation uses a LUT (look up table) to allow the user to adjust how the resistance varies according to temperature. You can however turn off the temperature based adjustment and use the LUT directly to give you the same control over the behavior of the resistance!

I'm looking forward to seeing what you all can do with this chip. While testing I've got it hooked up in a simple voltage divider. You could do something similar to control all sorts of things. LEDs, DC/DC converters, Op-Amps, the possibilities are endless!

I've been able to connect via BLE with some inexpensive readily available cooking thermometers. The ones I have all identify as "iBBQ". Someone on the great world wide web [wrote up its BLE specs](https://gist.github.com/uucidl/b9c60b6d36d8080d085a8e3310621d64), and I was able to create a CircuitPython library quickly.

I'd never used [adafruit.io](https://adafruit.io/) for anything before, so I cooked up a quick demo which gets temperatures and battery status via BLE and sends it on it via an [AirLift FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4264). I used the latest [CircuitPython MQTT library](https://learn.adafruit.com/mqtt-in-circuitpython/circuitpython-wifi-usage) which Brent R. released just yesterday. It worked great!

I'm also working on a CircuitPython library that implements all the services we provide for the [Bluefruit Playground app](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-playground-app). We have [Arduino code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino/blob/master/libraries/Bluefruit52Lib/examples/Peripheral/bluefruit_playground/bluefruit_playground.ino) for this, but haven't implemented it in CircuitPython yet. When I finish you'll be able to both send and receive data for all the on-board sensors, buttons, and peripherals on the Circuit Playground Bluefruit and the CLUE boards.

Finally, I'm still debugging spurious writes to the SAMD51 internal flash -- no breakthroughs yet, but I have some clues.

Together with PaintYourDragon, we are working on a new library for LED panels.  Dragon is doing the heavy lifting, creating the low level code (and Arduino bindings); I'm adapting it to fit CircuitPython.  In the future, CircuitPython will be able to drive displays like these, probably using the displayio module that is used for LCD and e-ink displays:

We are also working towards releasing version 5.1.0 of the core CircuitPython code, and I am doing more of the release-related tasks this time around.  Two exciting additions are ulab, which I've talked about in other updates; and support for "f-strings", a more modern and concise way to build strings than "%" or ".format()".  Both of these features are expected to be available on higher powered CircuitPython devices with SAMD51, nRF, and STM microcontrollers.

This week, we finished updating all the CircuitPython libraries to use the latest Pylint and implemented the Black Python formatter. This was a huge project - thanks to Dylan for all his hard work. We updated the [Pylint guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/improve-your-code-with-pylint) to include Black and reference the latest version of Pylint. If you're going to contribute code to a CircuitPython library, check out this guide for how to ensure your code is up to standards.

I'm currently working on the Bonsai Buckaroo guide. This guide will have all the details on the board, and examples for both the CLUE and the micro:bit. Keep an eye out for that coming soon!

This past week I have been working on a guide for adding a new Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect, which is the first part of adding a new Board to Blinka. You can check out the guide, which is available at [https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka).

After finishing that guide, I started on the guide for the next part, which is adding a new board to Blinka. This is probably the most difficult guide I've written due to the complexities of adding a new board and trying to explain it in an easy to understand way. Be sure to look out for the new Blinka guide coming soon.

In addition to the new guide, I will be applying a new look to the Web Bluetooth Dashboard that I had worked on a couple of weeks ago that one of our designers came up with. Be sure to look out for that as well.

This week I've continued adding low power support to the different chip families. SAMD51 and SAMD21 now work. The Spresense port is building but untested.

This week I'm working on STM32 support and hopefully starting iMX RT support after that. The trickiest bit is providing a higher resolution clock for PulseIn to use.

Once they are all preliminarily tested, I'll put out a call for folks to test it. So, keep an eye out.

Lastly, on Saturday I streamed myself working on TinyLogicFriend, which is logic analyzer firmware built on top of TinyUSB. It will hook into Sigrok on the desktop side. There is also a [recording of the stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qetJHmfNA_g).
