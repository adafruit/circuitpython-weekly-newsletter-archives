## TalkPython Podcast: Device Simulator Express

[![Device Simulator Express](../assets/20200714/20200714podcast.jpg)](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/272/no-iot-things-in-hand-simulate-them-with-device-simulator-expresse)

No IoT hardware things in hand? Simulate them with Device Simulator Express!

> Maybe you've heard of the Circuit Playground Express, BBC micro:bit, or the fancy Adafruit CLUE. They aren't too expensive (ranging from $25 to $50 each). But for large groups such as classrooms, this can be a lot of money. Moreover, getting your hands on these devices can sometimes be tricky as well. With an extension for VS Code called Device Simulator Express, you can have instant access to all three (virtually of course). This cool extension adds a visual emulator as well as the native interactions such as buttons and temperature sensors.

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20200714/blinka.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **262**!

**Updated Libraries!**

We updated nearly all our libraries this week! Most of it was a simple change to the README. For a list of this week's updated libraries, check out the [CircuitPython Library Report](https://adafruit-circuit-python.s3.amazonaws.com/adabot/bin/reports/circuitpython_library_report_20200710.txt).

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep checking back for updated download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

[![Bryan](../assets/20200714/bryan1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The main focus of my work over the last week has been the AS7341 11-Channel Multi-Spectral light sensor from AMS. This is a pretty neat sensor that holds a lot of capabilities in a small package. Within the 3x2mm footprint are 16 paired CMOS light sensors for separate light wavelength bands as well as two dedicated sensors with no/clear filter, one near-infrared, and one flicker detection sensor.

[![Bryan](../assets/20200714/bryan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This impressive collection of sensors is routed through a 16-bit 6-channel ADC that takes the raw measurements from the sensors and converts them to digital values that can be read out over I2C. 12 readable individual sensor elements don't exactly fit through a 6-channel ADC together so the chip includes a so-called Super MUX (SMUX) that allows you to route the signal from any sensor to any ADC channel. Now that's some super multiplexing!

[![Bryan](../assets/20200714/bryan3.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The sensor also includes interrupts for measurement thresholds, flicker detection and housekeeping stuff like FIFO overflows. One feature I find particularly interesting is the LDR pin that allows you to control an external LED to aide in spectral measurement. Current control allows you to use the LED to its full capacity without burning it out with too much current.

**Dan**

I'm continuing to work on an implementation of \_bleio that supports the HCI (Host Controller Interface) Bluetooth adapter protocol. [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_protocols#Host_Controller_Interface_(HCI)) is a serial protocol available on ESP32, used on our AirLift boards. In order to talk the HCI protocol to the adapter, I started with the [HCI communications code](https://github.com/adafruit/ArduinoBLE/blob/master/src/utility/HCI.cpp) in the ArduinoBLE library. But ArduinoBLE uses only a limited set of HCI commands, so I switched to using a complete set of HCI command definitions provided by [some include files in Zephyr](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/master/include/bluetooth). I redid the ArduinoBLE HCI code completely, and again got to the point I was at last week, where I was able to ask the adapter for its BLE address. So it's one step back and one step forward again, but this time wearing boots instead of flip-flops.

Now I'm implementing more of \_bleio, starting with advertising, and hope to have more things working in a few days.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20200714/jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

In the CircuitPython core, there are lots of things going on behind the scenes.  We use background tasks to ensure that things like audio, USB, and display keep working even while your code.py is running.  My current project is to enhance this code and restore performance that we gave up temporarily in order to add the "lower power" mode that is helpful for battery-powered projects.  Here's an idea of how the C source looks today.

**Kattni**

This week, I published the [74HC595 shift register guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/74hc595). This little chip is rather complicated to wire up, and previous to this, there was only an Arduino guide explaining what to do with it. There has been a CircuitPython library for it for quite some time, but no guide to using that either. So, I wrote up this guide which includes pinout details and a clear wiring diagram, as well as a CircuitPython example code to control 8 LEDs using SPI. The example displays a chase animation and then blinks the LEDs. 

Along with the guide, there was a bit of miscellaneous. I updated a couple of fritzing objects, created a couple new fritzing objects, tested and merged a couple of PRs and tended to some assigned GitHub issues.

Finally, I assisted with the translation of the first guide I ever wrote, [Circuit Playground Express: Piano in the Key of Lime](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-express-piano-in-the-key-of-lime) into [Spanish](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-express-piano-de-limones). A huge thank you to Àlvaro for all of his amazing work translating guides. The next guide up for translation is the Circuit Playground Express guide.

**Lucian**

This past week was partially consumed by my move into a new apartment in Boston. However, outside of packing boxes and hooking up internet, I've been doing more work on my Timer Allocator. This has included rewriting RGBMatrix to use the new system, updating the internal peripheral profiles of various chips to expose more timers, and other related bugfixes. In the process, I've uncovered some regressions with PulseIO which have snuck into the main branch, which I'm currently investigating. Sneaky regressions are always a frustrating find, and this most recent discovery has encouraged me to revisit some old tooling solutions for hardware-based regression testing that I benched this spring.

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20200714/melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This week I worked some more on the Blinka PyPortal library and wrote a guide for it. Along the way, I found several bugs for it with some of them occasionally stopping me from continuing on the guide without addressing the bugs. Eventually though, I was able to get everything working. I was able to get it running on both a Raspberry Pi 4 and the FT232H so that it could be run directly from my computer.

You can check out the guide on the [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/running-pyportal-code-on-blinka-with-displayio).

**Scott**

This week I'm focused on our WiFi and networking APIs in CircuitPython. I've settled on what modifications I want to make and now I've gotta do them. The gist is that I want our APIs to be better segmented to save memory when you aren't using some of the functionality and internally use smaller chunks of memory so they work more often with memory fragmentation.

My approach is to start from the beginning, WiFi scanning, and work through the examples. Watch my [Deep Dive streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqSpDUicYMI&list=PLjF7R1fz_OOXBHlu9msoXq2jQN4JpCk8A) for the latest information.

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
