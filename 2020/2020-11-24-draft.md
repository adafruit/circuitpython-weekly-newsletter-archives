* \_bleio adds support for HCI-based BLE co-processors, such as AirLift boards.
* aesio provides support for AES computations.
* async/await made available by default in many builds; support improved.
* Network modules are revamped, adding wifi, socketpool, ssl, and other modules. Disabled socket, wiznet5k and network modules. They will be removed in 7.x in favor of networking * libraries.
* Updated stage and pew libraries.
* \_pixelbuf improvements.
* Improved USB serial detection.
* json can now read from stream objects.
* pulseio.PWMOut is split out into pwmio.PWMOut. It is still available in pulseio, but that is deprecated and will be removed in 7.x.
* Added memorymonitor for memory debugging. It is not enabled by default.
* Reduced power consumption (light sleep) during time.sleep() when possible.

### CircuitPython 6.1.0 Beta 1

This is the second beta release of 6.1.0. (This first was broken.) It includes many changes that were done while 6.0.0 release candidates were in pre-release. Please use 6.0.x if you need a stable version of CircuitPython on all ports except ESP32-S2. Please use this release or newer for the ESP32-S2.

## ESP32-C3 RISC-V microcontroller information leaked

[![ESP32-C3](../assets/20201124/20201124esp.jpg)](https://twitter.com/hackaday/status/1330668980919537666)

It's very cool to see a high power RISC-V core from espressif. CircuitPython won't work on it, unfortunately, because the USB is a built-in usb to serial converter. Folks won't be able to do mass storage with it. Longer term, it might be able to support CircuitPython with a BLE-only CircuitPython workflow. No word on a MicroPython port possibility.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This week saw me doing guide work for some upcoming sensors, as well as new driver work for the MLX90395 3-axis magnetometer from Melexis. This is a neat sensor, similar in use to the TLV493D as it is designed for measuring the orientation and position of magnetic fields from magnets. It will be fun to see how this can be used for new and interesting motion detection or sensing projects!

**Dan**

I did the final steps for the CircuitPython 6.0.0 stable release on Monday evening. Thanks to all who worked on and tested this really significant release!

I am continuing to work on light sleep and deep sleep in CircuitPython, after significant work by Scott and @microDev.  [We iterated on the API](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/2796), and I'm now doing the boilerplate for that API. As soon as that compiles, I will then implement deep sleep for a time duration on the ESP32-S2 as the first case. Scott and microDev1 have done a lot of the internal work already, so I hope that part will not take long. Then I'll work on deep sleep for pin transitions, and then light sleep for both durations and pins.

**Jeff**

I did some bug fixing on esp32s2 during the past week.  First, I fixed a problem which prevented CircuitPython on the esp32s2 from connecting to certain secure websites, including thingspeak and adafruit io.  Second, I fixed a problem where the board would become unstable after using an I2C device.  Both are working much more stably now!

**Kattni**

This week I published the [Which CircuitPython Board is Right for You? guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/choose-your-circuitpython-board). This guide is designed to help you choose between CircuitPython boards based on different features such as WiFi enabled, Bluetooth enabled, built in display or tiny boards. It also has a page explaining the differences between the different chipsets available on CircuitPython compatible boards, and the pros and cons of each. If you've held off getting started with CircuitPython because you were overwhelmed by the choice of boards, or you're a seasoned pro trying to decide which board to get, this guide is for you!

I also tested an update to the PyBadger library. Thanks to @foamyguy, it now supports the new MagTag board. If you're looking to use your MagTag as a badge, check out the example included with this update.

**Melissa**

This past week I fixed the Raspberry Pi 1.3" display driver. When it was in orientations other than 0 degrees, the display was offset by 80 pixels. I rewrote the Device Tree Overlay based on a similar one we had for the 1.14" display, which was my first experience working on a Device Tree Overlay.

I added a few improvements to the MagTag library based on feedback from a few projects that were converted to work on it. My goal with this library was to make it extensible, but easy to develop on. One of the projects I made while developing this was a bitcoin display.

[![Melissa](../assets/20201124/20201124melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I've also been getting back into working on some of the web-based tools such as making a few fixes to my existing code and I started working on an online ESP Tool. The ESP tool would allow you to upload a bootloader and have it program your ESP board. It's not currently working, but I am debugging it at the moment.

**Scott**

This past week I've been doing my best to run down bugs CircuitPython. At the end of last week I was looking into adding grayscale EInk support and also found and fixed a couple bugs in our grayscale conversion. As of this morning, they are all merged into the main branch of CircuitPython.

We just released 6.0.0 stable, which is stable for our core platforms, SAMD21, SAMD51 and nRF52840. However, it isn't stable on the ESP32-S2 yet. So, I've been doing my best to find and fix issues. I attempted to release our first 6.1.0-beta.0 but it turned out to include a pretty nasty bug. So, I'm hoping to do a beta.1 today. Folks, with ESP32-S2 boards like the MagTag should continue to use the latest pre-release. It'll be better than 6.0.0 for the -S2.

This period of bug squishing happens for every new port we do for CircuitPython. Once we're through it, things should be very exciting. The -S2's native USB combined with WiFi and new low power API promises to bring CircuitPython's ease of use to a whole new class of long-running, connected applications.
