Hi everyone! It's the latest Python for Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## Python Leads the IEEE Top Programming Languages for 2020

[![Python the Top IEEE Programming Language](../assets/20200728/20200728ieee.jpg)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/tech-careers/top-programming-language-2020)

It’s been a turbulent year since the last time IEEE Spectrum broke out the digital measuring tools to probe the relative popularity of programming languages. Yet one thing remains constant: the dominance of Python.

> Our default ranking is weighted toward the interests of an IEEE member, and looking at the top entries, we see that Python has held onto its comfortable lead, with Java and C once again coming in second and third place, respectively. Arduino has seen a big jump, rising from 11th place to seventh.

One interpretation of Python’s high ranking is that its metrics are inflated by its increasing use as a teaching language: Students are simply asking and searching for the answers to the same elementary questions over and over. But Python is frequently used professionally and in high-profile realms, such as machine learning, thanks to its enormous collection of high quality, specialized libraries - [IEEE](https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/tech-careers/top-programming-language-2020).

## ALICE the Robot

The AS7341 is done, at least for now; The CircuitPython library has been released and is available in the bundle and via pip, and the Arduino library should be added to the library manager soon. It has been an interesting sensor to work on, and I'm interested to see what people do with it.

One thing I've been pondering lately is the value of documentation. When a device is poorly documented or there are large pieces of documentation just missing, it's not unlike losing your keys: You know you what you're looking for, but you just can't find it. Good documentation on the other hand removes the friction that comes when just trying to find the thing you know you need to know. Stellar documentation  (see Texas Instruments and Analog Devices) goes a step further and calls your attention to information that you didn't know you needed.

Bad documentation is like a bad community: it's just not enjoyable to work with, and makes one turn to more pleasant alternatives. 

**Dan**

I'm continuing a re-implementation of CircuitPython \_bleio that supports the HCI (Host Controller Interface) Bluetooth adapter protocol. [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_protocols#Host_Controller_Interface_(HCI)) is a serial protocol available on ESP32, used on our AirLift boards. I'm now working on the ATT (attribute) protocol, which exchanges information about what kind of data is available from a peer device, and sends the data back and forth. Sadly, this protocol is not implemented directly in the high-level HCI protocol, so I must provide it. I’m converting the ArduinoBLE library ATT code from C++ to C and using its basic structure.

Recently I dabbled in the Libraries side of CircuitPython. You can now fine tune the frequency of the crystal into DS3231 to make it keep even **more** accurate time. These chips were quite accurate to begin with, gaining or losing just a few seconds per month at most, but it's good to know that with care and the right test equipment you can improve them to be accurate to within just a few seconds per year. 

**Kattni**

This week, I published the [PMSA300I air quality sensor breakout guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/pmsa003i). The PMSA300I is similar to the PM2.5, but instead of UART, it uses I2C! This breakout comes with STEMMA QT connectors, so it's super simple to get started, with no soldering necessary. The guide covers all the details about the sensor, including pinouts and resource downloads. There are wiring diagrams and usage examples for both Arduino and CircuitPython. The CircuitPython section uses the fancy new Adafruit CircuitPython PM25 library, which makes getting particle data super simple. If you're looking to get started with your PMSA300I, check out this guide.

I also updated the [PM2.5 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/pm25-air-quality-sensor) to use the fancy new PM25 library - both sensors use the same code, with a simple change in set up. 

I've been helping @fede2 with translating Adafruit Learn guides. This week, in preparation for translating the Circuit Playground Express guide, Àlvaro published [Makecode para la Circuit Playground Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/makecode-es), and he's currently working on the CircuitPython Made Easy on CPX and Bluefruit guide which is linked to from the CPX guide. Àlvaro has been putting so much work into translations - it's amazing to see and we really appreciate it!

Finally, I've been doing plenty in Fritzing land. I put together wiring diagrams for a couple of guides, and have been creating Fritzing objects for some new and it's-not-out-yet-don't-ask products. If you want a sneak peak at upcoming products, check out the [Adafruit Fritzing library](https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library/tree/master/parts) for recent additions!

**Lucian**

[![Lucian](../assets/20200728/20200728lucian.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This week, I worked on the implementation of PMWOut on the ESP32-S2, enabling PWM frequency and duty cycle modulation for LEDs and servo motors. It's been a breath of fresh air working with the ESP32, after coming from STM32 and NXP. Both of the latter companies have powerful chips, the also have very technical and sometimes convoluted documentation - Espressif clearly puts a lot of care into their API docs and examples to make them readable, and it shows. It's always nice to see hardware producers take extra steps to make high quality documentation and raise the standard for the rest of the industry.

I also worked on reviews for the STM32 F1 implementation, and the upcoming STM32 SDIO module, alongside preliminary work for the rest of ESP32-S2 PulseIO. The ESP's interface has been inspiring me to think of ways to use it in my own projects - though it's regrettable that the Bluetooth was cut to make room for native USB. I'm impatient for the day that we finally get our 500MHz Wifi/Bluetooth FS USB chip for under a dollar... but my fantasies for [capable computing](https://medium.com/@aallan/capable-computing-50867847a8d8) will have to wait.

[![Melissa](../assets/20200728/20200728melissa2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week, I started out by looking at the Arduino ImageReader library because a user had pointed out that they were not able to get the example working on an M0 processor. It appears the result was due to an incomplete implementation on my part. So I dove in and started working on converting a similar class written for TFT displays to work on the eInk displays. As I went along, there were various states of success as it got closer to completion. Eventually, I got it drawing correctly and it's now integrated into the Arduino library.

After I finished the eInk displays, I moved over to writing a library that makes use of the RGB Matrix and Metro M4 Airlift Lite to provide a library to make using the Matrix with the internet as easy as the PyPortal library makes using the PyPortal. I decided to part from the way that PyPortal works and provide more of a library of functions which initializes the function rather a monolithic library that does one thing very well. I have decided to call the library MatrixPortal and am continuing to add functionality. Be sure to keep an eye out for it.

**Scott**

Last week I had a variety of tweaks to CircuitPython out for PR including switching to PyStack, adding `memorymonitor`, removing the existing network APIs and adding `.find` to `bytearray`. They've been merged and we're due for another release.

Yesterday, I continued work on the ESP32SPI and Requests libraries to optimize them for memory use. I was testing an unreleased PyPortal project to see if it can work. Memory use does look better but is still a challenge.

The end of this week I'm switching gears a little bit to add networking support to the ESP32S2 and also verifying some hardware design assumptions.

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/20200728/codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
